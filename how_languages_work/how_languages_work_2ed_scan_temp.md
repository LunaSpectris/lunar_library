How Languages Work

An Introduction to Language and Linguistics

Language is a sophisticated tool which we use to communicate in a multitude of ways.
Updated and expanded in its second edition, this book introduces language and linguistics –
presenting language in all its amazing complexity while systematically guiding you through the basics.
You will emerge with an appreciation of the diversity of the world’s languages, as well as a deeper
understanding of the structure of human language, the ways it is used, and its broader social and
cultural context.
Part I is devoted to the nuts and bolts of language study – speech sounds, sound patterns, sentence
structure and meaning – and includes chapters dedicated to the functional aspects of language: discourse,
prosody, pragmatics, and language contact. The fourteen language profiles included in Part II reveal
the world’s linguistic variety while expanding on the similarities and differences between languages.
Using knowledge gained from Part I, you will explore how language functions when speakers use it in
daily interaction.
With a step-by-step approach that is reinforced with well-chosen illustrations, case studies, and study
questions you will gain understanding and analytical skills that will only enrich your ongoing study
of language and linguistics.

Carol Genetti is a Professor of Linguistics and the Anne and Michael Towbes Graduate Dean at
University of California, Santa Barbara.

**PREFACE**

```
How Languages Work is designed to be the primary text for a university-level introductory
course in linguistics. The audience for the book includes:
```
tundergraduates taking an introductory linguistics course as a general education requirement;
tbeginning linguistics students with limited background in the field;
tlinguistics graduate students seeking a helpful reference and introductory discussions of a
wide range of sub-disciplines and a range of languages;
tstudents in related disciplines (such as education, anthropology, writing, or communica-
tion) that seek grounding in linguistics; and
tgeneral readers with an avid love of languages.

```
In addition to courses offered within departments of linguistics, the book might be used in
departments of anthropology, education, psychology, communication, applied linguistics,
English, or other languages. It introduces the field of linguistics through its subfields, and
prepares students for more advanced and specialized coursework.
```

**ACKNOWLEDGMENTS**

This book has been the work of many hands over many years. My sincere thanks go out
to the contributing authors, whose combined experience in linguistics can be counted in
centuries and whose deep insights into language enrich every page of this book. They have
been extraordinarily patient with me as I’ve pursued this project simultaneously with many
others and have graciously accepted deeper editing than they are typically accustomed to as
I’ve strived to bring unity and a consistent voice to these pages. I have greatly appreciated
their wisdom, patience, good humor, and sheer hard work.
This book would never have come into existence without the dedicated energy of numer-
ous graduate students – former and current – in the Department of Linguistics at the
University of California, Santa Barbara. First and foremost, it is my pleasure to acknowl-
edge Allison Adelman, whose meticulous attention to detail and love of good writing have
served to improve this book greatly. I strongly doubt that I would ever have brought this
to completion if I hadn’t had her partnership, flexibility, and cheerful persistence to rely
on, and for this she will have my unending gratitude. For the website materials, especially
the interactive elements, I enthusiastically thank Carlos Nash for visioning and revision-
ing what might be possible and bringing them to fruition. I’m also grateful for the early
partnership of Kobin Kendrick, who helped to shape and creatively transform and extend
my initial ideas. Other graduate students who have contributed in ways too numerous
to mention include Dibella Caminsky, Onna Nelson, Nicholas Lester, Rebekka Siemens,
Kira Griffitt, Veronica Muñoz LedoYañez, Jennifer Garland, and Mara Henderson. UC Santa
Barbara undergraduates have also commented, corrected, and test-run these materials; I
especially note the careful work of Kristin Dunkinson, Kaveh Vee, and David Prine.
The Cambridge University Press editorial team has provided constant encouragement
and expert advice. Thanks especially to Andrew Winnard and Rosemary Crawley for their
encouragement, helpfulness, and impressive expertise.
The first edition of this book was partly written when I was in residence as a Distinguished
Visiting Fellow at the Cairns Institute, James Cook University, in Cairns, Australia. My
thanks to Sasha Aikhenvald and R. M. W. Dixon for their contributions, friendship, and
support. UC Santa Barbara has been the home of this book, both intellectually and in
financial support. I am grateful to the Division of Humanities and Fine Arts and the Office

of the Executive Vice Chancellor for research funds that have made this project possible.
Development of the web materials was supported in part by Instructional Improvement
Grants from the Office of Instructional Development.
Finally, I thank Paul, Olivia, and Marcus for their love, support, uncomplaining patience,
and constant inspiration.
I dedicate this book to the UC Santa Barbara Linguistics graduate students: past, present,
and future.

**THE BOOK’S APPROACH**

This textbook explores how languages work: the “pieces” of languages and the principles
governing their nature and how they fit together; the ways in which language conveys
meaning; how humans use language as the substance of everyday interaction; the role
of language in society and culture; how languages adapt and change over time; and how
they are learned by children and adults. It presents language as a quintessentially human
activity, showing how languages are grounded in human physiology and cognition, and
are both reflective and creative of human societies and cultures. It emphasizes the dynamic
and constantly changing nature of language. Teaching students this broader context allows
them to understand the forces that shape language, hence to gain a deeper understanding
of linguistic principles and structures.
The book does not introduce any particular “formalist” theoretical paradigm (such as
Generative Grammar) but describes grammatical structures from the perspective of linguis-
tic typology. It thus follows a broad international consensus on the nature of linguistic cat-
egories and structures. It is an appropriate choice for faculty members who wish to provide
their students with a rigorous orientation to language and linguistics without introducing
formal models. This book is highly technical and analytical, and requires exacting atten-
tion to structural detail. Grammar is presented in significant depth and the material may at
times be challenging. However, a major focus of the text is to provide students with explicit
direction that will help them acquire analytical skills. In addition, the associated website
includes numerous learning aids (such as interactive tutorials) that support this process.
The password-protected instructor materials on the website include suggestions for sections
to assign (and not assign) for classes with a less technical emphasis.
Importantly, this book is strongly cross-linguistic in its orientation; the focus is not just
on **_language_** but also on **_languages_**. In exposing readers to languages from across the
globe, it serves as an introduction to the world’s linguistic diversity. Cross-linguistic com-
parisons are important not only because they allow us to classify languages but also because
they reveal what a language is or might be. Understanding the similarities and differences
between languages is essential to the development of empirically justifiable theories about
language. In addition, linguistic variety is simply fascinating and fun; it reveals much about
humankind, and the thousands of ways that particular communities of speakers have

categorized and represented the world around them. For that reason, this book contains a
special feature: a set of Language Profiles , each written by a linguist who has conducted
extensive fieldwork in the community that they write about (with the exception of Guy
Deutscher, whose profile is on the long-extinct language Akkadian, which is attested on
excavated clay tablets). After a brief introduction to the language and the community in
which it is spoken, each language profile provides an overview of the basic structures and
then goes into depth on one or more topics that tie in with the primary chapters. The
profiled languages were selected to represent languages of diverse locations, families, and
types. Together, these fourteen short studies serve not only to reinforce and illustrate the
main points of the primary chapters but also to expose the reader to the world’s linguistic
diversity.
```
```
The Book’s Structure
The book contains fifteen primary chapters and fourteen language profiles. These can be
fit into academic programs in a number of ways. The book provides more than sufficient
material for a semester-long introductory course. It can also be used in a shorter academic
quarter, with instructors selecting the topics they deem the most crucial for students within
their programs. It can also be used across multiple courses; for example, the language pro-
files can be used in subsequent courses on linguistic analysis, morphosyntax, or languages
of the world. Chapters not covered in an introductory course can serve as initial readings
in more specialized topic-specific courses (such as on language acquisition). The material
could also be expanded to a two-quarter or year-long course, although in the latter case
some supplementary readings may be desirable. Further discussion on different ways to
structure courses and how to incorporate the language profiles are available on the instruc-
tor’s portion of the website.
The chapters in this book follow the traditional format of tracing linguistic structure,
beginning with the smallest units (sounds), building up to successively larger units, and
ending with discourse. Chapters on orthogonal topics – such as semantics, language change,
and language acquisition – follow the structural chapters. Several chapters are included on
a variety of topics that are not typically found in introductory textbooks. These include
prosody, discourse, pragmatics, and language contact.
The theoretical perspective and broad coverage of this book allow it to fill a niche in the
market that is currently not covered by other texts. The contributing authors are practicing
linguists and distinguished leaders in their given fields. The editor and each author, while
not losing their individual voice, maintain a consistent chapter structure and level through-
out, to ensure a smooth reading experience for the student. The text is contemporary and
up to date. Most importantly, it presents language in the full richness of its context, as a
complex dynamic tool shaped by generations of speakers through discourse interactions,
adaptive to the broader social and cultural context in which it is embedded. Readers will
develop a deep appreciation of the beauty, complexity, and sheer genius of language, and
of humankind to whom it belongs.

Changes to the Second Edition

```
The Second Edition contains a number of enrichments and improved features. Most
substantively, this edition contains a new language profile on African-American English
that is well integrated with Chapter 11: Language in the Social World. The latter has been
restructured and updated. In addition, Chapter 2, Phonetics: the Physical Dimensions
of Speech Sounds, has been expanded to include a description of British English, and
both British and American English are represented in the examples, exercises, and asso-
ciated sound files. This will make it easier for the text to be used in classrooms in the
United Kingdom. It also allows for direct comparison between these two major English
dialects.
Other changes include:
```
```
ta significant increase in the number of exercises in the primary chapters;
tincreased examples from English and other major world languages in the main text and
the exercises;
tclarification of the distinction between Textboxes and Sidebars, and the addition of a dis-
tinct category of “Stop and Reflect” boxes;
tgreater integration of website materials and Language Profiles through increased
cross-referencing;
treduction of highlighted text to better emphasize primary points;
tupdated suggestions for further readings;
toverall streamlining of prose.

The website materials are important companions to the book. The website contains a range
of materials that will help instructors teach the course and help students engage with and
master the skills of linguistic analysis.
Online resources for students include:

**FOR STUDENTS: HOW TO USE THIS BOOK**

Linguistics is a highly diverse and interdisciplinary field, encompassing phenomena as var-
ied as the concrete details of physical acoustics, abstract logical argument, concise gram-
matical structures, and rich observations on culture and society. There are few people for
whom all of it comes easily – everyone has their favorite subfields – but it is all essential;
every subfield deeply interacts with all others. This book has been designed with students
in mind and has many features to facilitate acquisition of the skills necessary to fully appre-
ciate the complexity of language.
It is important in linguistics to engage with the text. Linguistics is not a field where you
read quickly and lightly. It is better not to plan to cover too much at one time and not to
hurry through it; take adequate time to fully work through a couple of sections, and then
take a break. Throughout the primary chapters, you will find that **_key points have been
put in bold italics_**. Of course, there are many other important points that you will want
to note as well.
Be sure to really think about the discussion and make it your own; take time to reflect on
your own lifelong experience of language and connect it to what you are learning, and try
to become conscious of language use as you are immersed in it daily. This practice will take
your understanding to an entirely new level.
Textboxes contain case studies and important related points and should always be read.
“Stop and Reflect” boxes give you the opportunity to consider important questions or try
your hand at linguistic analysis; taking time to work through these will facilitate your learn-
ing. Sidebars provide information on online resources as well as cross-references to related
discussions in other parts of the book. Wireless icons ( ) direct you to specific online
resources that are relevant at particular points in the text.
You will find that the pages are filled with examples taken from languages throughout
the world. Most of these are numbered and set off from the text. It is critical that you spend
time looking at these in detail, even if you are tempted to skip over them to continue with
the main text. They are as important as the text itself: each informs the other and neither
can be fully understood in isolation. You will find that words from other languages are usu-
ally broken into their component parts and that translations of the meanings of each part
are provided. Often these translations are abbreviated and put in small caps, for example,

SG for singular. Each chapter has a list of the glossing conventions used within it positioned
just before the exercises. A full list of all glossing conventions in the book can also be found
on pages xviii–xxi.
One of the essential features of this book is its focus on linguistic analysis. This is the
process by which you take a linguistic expression (a word, a sentence, a stretch of discourse)
and figure out all of its parts and subparts and how they contribute to the whole. This
fine-grained analysis then leads us to a broader understanding of how languages work, the
underlying principles, and how the design of languages both serves and reflects their func-
tions as tools of human communicative interaction.
There are many methods of linguistic analysis, depending on which aspects of language
are being studied. For example, determining which aspects of phonetic articulation are
meaningful in a language is a very different (though surprisingly not unrelated) exercise
from determining whether two languages are members of the same language family, or
whether a language differentiates active voice from passive voice. Learning how to apply
these methods is central to learning linguistics. In order to make this as easy as possible,
methodologies are presented in step-by-step fashion. “Stop and Reflect” boxes prompt you
to apply the methods to further data sets. Each chapter has a set of exercises that allow you
to analyze new data. In addition, there are many resources on the companion website that
serve as aids for improving your analytical skills. These include interactive tutorials, step-
by-step instructions, guides to writing in linguistics, and other chapter-specific resources.
Linguistics has extensive terminology that must be learned to understand the field suc-
cessfully. The Glossary in the back of the book provides simple definitions and is an impor-
tant reference tool. All words in the Glossary are presented in bold at first mention (as well
as later in the book if they haven’t been mentioned for a while, as a reminder that a glossary
entry is available). Chapter-specific glossaries are available on the website. There are also
online flashcards for each chapter to help you memorize terms.
Another important component of the website is the addition of sound files. The major-
ity of instances of language use are spoken, and sound is an integral part of most lan-
guages (sign languages being the exception). Throughout this book (and others) you will
see speech sounds represented by letters and other two-dimensional symbols, but keep in
mind that these are only representations of sounds, not sounds themselves. In moving to the
abstraction of representation, considerable richness is lost. To partially address this, espe-
cially for those chapters that focus on sound (phonetics, phonology, and prosody), many of
the examples are accompanied by sound files accessible on the How Languages Work website;
these are indicated by the wireless icon. Take the time to listen to them carefully. Most of
the language profiles also have sound files, typically of recorded texts. These provide a tan-
gible sense of the language and its speakers that cannot be otherwise replicated.
One of the most fascinating aspects of studying linguistics is learning about the tremen-
dous variety – and ingenuity – of human languages. Linguistic diversity is both captivating
and fun. In addition, understanding linguistic diversity is critical to understanding the
broader principles that underlie languages, i.e., how languages work, and what languages
do. The primary chapters in the book are replete with examples taken from languages across
the globe. In addition, the book contains fourteen language profiles, which are case studies
```

**xxviii For Students: How to Use This Book**

```
in shorter chapters that focus on particular languages. Your instructor may assign these, or
you may just want to explore languages of particular regions or particular types on your
own. Reading the whole set of language profiles will serve to significantly advance your
understanding of linguistics. Not only do they allow the widespread application of linguis-
tic concepts to many different languages, but they also illustrate the diversity of language
types, especially as regards their grammatical structures. Textbox 0.1 provides a list of the
language profiles in relation to the chapters to which they correspond; it is best to read the
relevant chapter first.
```
```
My own experience with linguistics is that the farther I climb, the greater the vistas I
behold. I hope that students will find their own vistas by exploring the field far beyond
this book. To encourage this, every chapter and language profile contains a list of suggested
readings with a brief note about each entry; these can provide some potential next steps
toward a deeper understanding of this quintessential aspect of our humanity.

Language plays a crucial role in our lives as a functional system of human communication. It
is central to our cultures and societies, and has played a significant role in Western intellectual
history of the study of philosophy, mind, ancient history, and culture. Linguistics is the scientific
study of language. This chapter provides an orientation both to language and to the field of
linguistics. It introduces the languages of the world, their distribution and demographics, the
important issue of language endangerment and death, and the worldwide effort to document
and conserve the world’s languages. It then provides an orientation to the field of linguistics and
an overview of the major subfields of the discipline.
```
### LIST OF AIMS

At the end of this chapter, students will be able to:
tarticulate the importance of language to human lives and society;
tdiscuss the ways in which language is a functional system of human communication;
ttake an objective, descriptive approach to discussion of language-related issues;
tbegin to identify fine details of linguistic structure;

1.1.1 Language and You; Language and Us

```
Language is an essential and ubiquitous component of our lives. To see that this
statement is true for yourself, take a moment to think about your day. Cast your mind
back to when you first awoke. What were your thoughts and how were they expressed?
Trace the day in your mind and try to count how many
people you spoke with, even if it was just a quick “hi” or
“thank you.” Did you listen to a lecture? Watch television?
Talk on the phone? Make an appointment? Sing a song?
All of these activities centrally involve language. Now think
about what you read today. Perhaps a newspaper, pages on
the Internet, email, advertisements, labels, signs, home-
work assignments? Now move on to thought itself. What
thoughts and ideas have passed through your mind? Have
you made explicit plans, imagined conversations, debated
with yourself? If you are like most people, this brief exer-
cise has revealed that language is both within and around
you, a constant part of your internal and external existence.
Language is the primary medium which you use to interact
with people and institutions in our society. Your particular
use of language is also a reflection of who you are as an
individual; all of us use language as a means to build and
portray our identities in the world around us. We also use
language to shape and interpret the great and small experi-
ences of our lives.
Think about the broader world in which we live. Language is the principal means by
which societies are constructed and cultures are developed. Think of the size of our soci-
ety’s great libraries, and how the majority of the volumes in those vast collections (14.6
million volumes in the Harvard University Library alone) are language in its written form.
The intellectual achievements of humankind are essentially embodied in language. Not
only is this true of the written works that formally encapsulate our knowledge, but it is
also true of the huge body of indigenous knowledge held by the speakers of thousands of
languages across the globe, from the Brazilian Amazon to the Mongolian steppes. Some
may argue that music and art are non-linguistic, but note that they often incorporate lan-
guage, as with lyrics. Even works that do not contain language are interpreted and under-
stood through verbal thought, discussion, and critical analysis. Similarly, mathematics
could be argued to be non-linguistic, but again language is used to teach, understand, and
interpret it.
Beyond the modern world, consider that language has been used by humans for at
least 30,000 years, by thousands of groups across the globe, wherever humans have ven-
tured. Speakers of each generation endow their language with their own unique mark,
their own contribution, changing it in myriad subtle ways. As language passes from

generation to generation, it shifts and adapts to the ever-changing world in which it is
embedded.
The preceding paragraphs emphasized that language is a pervasive and essential
part both of your own life and of who we are as humankind. The goal of this book is
to begin to address the question: How does language work? It is a simple question, and one
that most people never think to ask. Language is so automatic – almost like breathing – that
most people don’t realize the complexity that underlies it and the subtle and effortless skill
with which they wield it.
The question How does language work? may itself be simple, but the answer is highly
complex. It can be broken down into many smaller questions. To begin with, one must
ask: How do individual languages work? We really can’t understand the nature of language
in its broad sense if we don’t understand the mechanisms underlying particular languages,
preferably of many and diverse kinds. Other key questions include: What are all the pieces
of a language? How do the pieces combine and work together to allow for communication
to occur? How are languages learned and transmitted? How do languages influence each
other? How do languages change over time? These are but a small number of the many
questions that define the field of linguistics , the scientific study of language. But before
discussing the field in more detail, it is important to continue with our exploration of the
nature of language.
```
```
1.1.2 Language Is Human and All That Implies
Language is a defining trait of humankind. Language is tied up with our thought pro-
cesses, our ability to reason, to self-reflect, and to develop advanced civilizations. Other
animal species have developed communication systems, but they pale in comparison to
human language. A simple illustration of this is the fact that no system of animal commu-
nication appears to be able to communicate events that occurred in the past or events that
are imaginary. Neither are there animal communication systems that have adverbs or other
devices that allow for detailed descriptions of actions. Animals have nothing comparable in
scale, complexity, subtlety, or adaptability to human language.
The fact that language is human has a number of important implications for the nature
of language. Language is embedded into our physiology, our cognition, and our thought
processes. Many of the details of linguistic structure are directly dependent on this. For
example, the fact that no language makes sounds by curling the tip of the tongue back
to touch the uvula (the small appendage hanging down in the middle of the back of the
mouth) is directly explainable by the details of human anatomy. Less trivially, anatomical
facts are also responsible for a number of features of sound systems, such as the com-
mon trend to pronounce a sequence of t and y as “ch” (e.g., gotcha from got you ). More
importantly, language processes are largely resident in the brain and so language shares
characteristics with other cognitive functions; for example, language is both learnable and
adaptable.
Humans use language for a wide variety of purposes. We communicate everything from
urgent warnings to random thoughts, proposals of marriage to complaints. We use it to
cajole, threaten, placate, inform, entertain, and command. In other words, language is
```

**6 Carol Genetti**

```
functional; it is a tool of human communication. The fact that language is used for a wide
variety of tasks has direct implications for how it is structured. Linguistic structures are flex-
ible and adaptable, able to express all that humans convey to each other in the course of a
conversation, a day, a lifetime, a civilization.
Language is also human in that language is a form of human social behavior. It can be
used to build or break social bonds. It serves as a social cue to the formality or informality
of a situation, and to the degree of social intimacy or distance among the people speaking.
When children acquire language, they do so by using it as a tool of social interaction within
particular social settings. The social component of human language is also reflected in how
language is used and structured.
Humans use language to interact, and using language is an inherently interactional task.
Not only are we listening to our conversational partner and picking up on the many sub-
tleties of word choice, sentence structure, rate of speech, and intonation, we are also con-
stantly assessing when and how to take a turn, and how to communicate our message so
that the person to whom we are speaking (the addressee ) will correctly interpret what we
are saying. To take a simple example, I wouldn’t say He is coming for dinner tonight if I didn’t
think that the addressee had in mind the person I refer to as he. Otherwise, I could use a
proper name like Mike or a more elaborate phrase like the guy from across the hall. I could also
start off with an introduction, such as You know that guy I was telling you about that owns the
cocker spaniels? All three of these strategies accomplish a similar end of introducing the idea
of the person I wish to discuss into the mind of the addressee. Once I am confident that the
addressee can identify the correct individual, I can communicate the primary message He’s
coming to dinner tonight. Thus, we see that the interactional component of language is both
deep and subtle. The structures of human language reflect our interactional needs.
Humans are creative and language is structured to take advantage of human creativity.
All languages are constructed in a way that allows for the creation of novel utterances; any
language can produce an infinite number of sentences. Therefore we cannot describe a
language by simply making a list of all the possible sentences it contains. Instead, our task
is to describe the design principles underlying language that make that infinite number
of sentences possible. Obvious instances of human creativity with language include word
games, puns, and puzzles. Humans also use language creatively when they innovate new
expressions or use one or more words in a new way. For example, the English word way has
been used for some time to intensify the meaning of certain types of quantifiers ( way too
much, way more than necessary ) or prepositions ( way up, way over ). Younger speakers of some
English dialects can now use this intensifier with adjectives; e.g., way cool. The use of way
with adjectives can have specific affective (emotional) implications, e.g., way unfair. We
don’t know who first used way to intensify an adjective, but in doing so that person was
performing a creative act, using the word in a new grammatical environment. People do
this every day. Most of the time grammatical innovations are not repeated, but sometimes
particular innovations catch on. Other speakers hear the innovation and use it themselves,
spreading it wave-like across a significant portion of the speech community , a group of
people who share a common language or dialect and cultural practices. If an innovation
continues to spread, it could become a regular feature of the language and constitute a
```

**7 1 Introduction**

```
language change. Many instances of language change are direct reflections of human
creativity.
To summarize, just as language is deeply a part of humankind, the human element is
deeply a part of language. The structures of language take the form they do because language
is instantiated by the human body, as a tool of human communication, and is embedded in
human interaction within societies and cultures. Language is at the core of what it is to be
human, and humanity is at the core of language.
```
```
1.1.3 Language Is Dynamic and Adaptable
Language is in a constant process of change. The language you speak with your friends
today is somewhat different from the way your grandparents spoke to their friends when
they were your age. Chances are good that your own grandchildren will probably think that
your speech sounds a little old-fashioned. While the difference between grandparents and
grandchildren may not be dramatic, over a longer time span, for example, that between
oneself and one’s grandchildren’s grandchildren’s grandchildren, the cumulative effect
of those generations becomes more noticeable. We can see this in the history of English.
Consider the following passage, written by William Shakespeare just over three hundred
years ago, and taken from the play King Henry V :
```
```
Now, fie upon my false French! By mine honour in true English, I love thee, Kate: by
which honour I dare not swear thou lovest me; yet my blood begins to flatter me that
thou dost, notwithstanding the poor and untempering effect of my visage.
```
```
While educated English speakers will be able to understand this passage, children and
adults with less formal education will find it difficult. It is easy to identify the linguistic fea-
tures that mark this as archaic: the use of the old second-per-
son familiar pronouns, thee and thou ; the inflected verb
forms lovest and dost ; and the use of now antiquated words
and expressions, such as fie upon and visage. When we look
further back, for example at The Canterbury Tales , written by
Geoffrey Chaucer more than six hundred years ago, the lan-
guage becomes even harder to decipher. Consider these lines
from “The Wife of Bath’s Tale”:
And if thou kanst nat tellen it anon
Yet shal I yeve thee leve for to gon
A twelf-month and a day to seche and leere
An answere suffisant in this mateere;
And suretee wol I han, er that thou pace,
Thy body for to yelden in this place.
```
```
While some of it seems familiar and suggestive of meaning, much is unclear to the eye of
the untrained modern English speaker. The passage is easier to decipher if one learns that
yeve means ‘give,’ seche and leere means ‘search and learn,’ suretee means ‘certainty,’ and
yelden means ‘surrender.’
```
### SIDEBAR 1.2

```
There are a number of websites that
provide translations of Shakespeare into
Modern English, including No Sweat
Shakespeare (www.nosweatshakespeare
.com). If you want to look up this
passage, it is in Act V, Scene II.
```

### STOP AND REFLECT 1.1 TRANSLATING OLD ENGLISH TO MODERN

```
Try providing a modern English translation of the lines from “The Wife of Bath’s Tale,” and compare it with
that given in Textbox 1.1.
```
### TEXTBOX 1.1 MODERN ENGLISH TRANSLATIONS OF THE CANTERBURY TALES

```
Here is one translation of the excerpt from “The Wife of
Bath’s Tale,” provided by the online bookshop Librarius
(www.librarius.com/canttran/wftltrfs.htm):
And if you cannot tell it me anon, then will I give
you license to be gone a twelvemonth and a day, to
search and learn sufficient answer in this grave con-
cern. And your knight’s word I’ll have, before forth
you pace, to yield your body to me in this place.
```
```
Of course, you would never speak this way to
someone in a conversation today. A more colloquial
current translation might be “And if you can’t tell
me soon, then I’ll give you permission to be gone
for a year and a day, to find the right answer to this
important question. I’ll have you promise as a knight,
before you leave, that you will give me your life in this
place.”
```
```
All aspects of language can undergo change. Sounds can enter a language or fall out of
use. Sentence structures can shift in interesting ways. Words can develop into prefixes,
suffixes, or other small linguistic units. Word meanings can be broadened, narrowed, or
otherwise shifted. The social implications of using particular words and phrases can change
over time, as can larger patterns, such as how we structure and present information.
Language adapts to the world around it. Think of all the vocabulary you use in daily life
that your grandparents did not use when they were your age. The words email, nanotechnol-
ogy, cell phone , and internet are just a few of the terms that reflect the technological changes
that swept over us in the late twentieth century. In the meantime, words like hogshead (a
large cask or barrel) and demijohn (a narrow-necked bottle enclosed in wicker) are not part
of the vocabulary of most people living today (although they might persist in certain sub-
groups of the population). Changes in vocabulary can reflect social changes as well. The
English word spinster , meaning an unmarried woman past the age of marrying, has vanished
from everyday vocabulary in most of modern society, together with the idea that there is
an age of marrying and that marriage and family are the primary goals of a woman’s life.
While changes in vocabulary reflecting innovations or social change are probably the
most obvious examples of the adaptability of language, languages also undergo adaptations
under the influence of language contact. When speakers of two distinct languages inter-
act with each other in large numbers over a period of time, one or both languages generally
undergo change. An example of a language affected by language contact is English, which
adopted huge numbers of words from French after the Norman invasion. Indeed, in the
sentence you just read, the words example, adopt, huge, number, French, Norman , and invasion
all came into English from French!
Language contact can have a much greater effect than simply adding new vocabulary.
Sounds, word structures, and sentence structures can also take on qualities of adjacent

languages. For example, in the Tibeto-Burman language family (comprising over three hun-
dred related languages distributed over Southeast Asia, Tibet, and the Himalayan region),
the majority of languages place the verb at the end of the sentence. A simplified and trans-
lated version of a sentence with this word order might be, for example, John apple ate.
However, there is one group of Tibeto-Burman languages, the Karenic group, which places
the verb in the middle of the sentence. Thus, they would say John ate apple. Interestingly,
speakers of the Karenic languages have been interacting for centuries with the Thai and the
Chinese, and both groups speak languages that put the verb in the middle. It is clear that
over the centuries, bilingual Karenic speakers matched their sentence structures to those
of their neighboring languages. Thus, a significant change to Karenic grammar resulted
from language contact through the medium of bilingualism. We see that languages adapt
not only to the changing technological world but also to the broader social environments
in which they are embedded.

1.1.4 Language Is Structured and Systematic
When one begins to look closely at language, one is immediately struck by the fact that
regular and recurring patterns form the basis of linguistic structure. To begin to
explore this aspect of language, take a moment to work through the following small exer-
cise on English grammar:
```
```
Regular Patterning of the English Past-Tense Suffix
In English most verbs have a predictable past-tense form. It is written as - ed but has differ-
ent pronunciations. You can discover this in your own speech very easily. Pronounce the
following lists of words and listen closely to the sound at the end of each word:
```
```
List A: baked, blessed, heaped, puffed, crashed
List B: rubbed, waved, lagged, billed, hummed
List C: waited, faded, booted, coded, righted
```
```
If you are a native English speaker and have a sensitive ear, you will have noticed that the
words in List A end in <t>, the words in List B end in <d>, and the words in List C end in
<ed>. We can now refer to these as the T-List, the D-List, and the ED-List.
Now try pronouncing the following three nonsense words, again listening carefully to
how the suffix is pronounced in each word:
```
```
Word 1: smipped
Word 2: croomed
Word 3: pluted
```
```
Notice that you don’t have to think for an instant which sound to put at the end, but that you
automatically end Word 1 with <t>, Word 2 with <d>, and Word 3 with <ed>, even though
these are nonsense words which you are unlikely to have ever heard or pronounced before.
Take a minute to examine the consonants that directly precede the suffix (i.e., the
“pre-suffixal” consonants) in the T-List words. Now compare the pre-suffixal consonants in
the D- and ED-List words. Notice that the lists are distinct; you don’t find any of the T-List
```

**10 Carol Genetti**

```
pre-suffixal consonants in D-List words, etc. Now determine which lists Words 1–3 fall into,
based on their pre-suffixal consonants.
You will see that Word 1 has a T-List consonant (p) and the suffix is pronounced as <t>,
Word 2 has a D-List consonant (m) and the suffix is pronounced as <d>, and Word 3 has an
ED-List consonant (t) and the suffix is pronounced as <ed>. You have discovered a system-
atic fact of English: the pronunciation of the past-tense suffix depends upon the pre-suffixal
consonant. Even though Words 1–3 are nonsense words, they still follow the systematic
patterns of pronunciation that form a significant part of the English language. We can state
this pattern as follows:
```
**(1)** In English, the past tense - _ed_ will be pronounced: as <t> following the consonants <k, s, p, f, sh>,
as <d> following <b, v, d, l, m>, and as <ed> following <t> or <d>.

### STOP AND REFLECT 1.2 ALTERNATE PRONUNCIATIONS OF THE ENGLISH PAST-

### TENSE SUFFIX

```
The statement in (1) is only part of the pattern, as not all possible consonants are exemplified. The lists for
two of the groups are actually much larger than shown here. Can you determine which two groups these are?
```
```
This is a statement of a pattern or systematic fact of English (sometimes referred to as a
rule). One can predict how the past tense - ed will be pronounced on any English verb as
long as one knows the pre-suffixal consonant.
Once we have observed a regular pattern in language, we ask the question: Why should
this pattern occur? This question is critical, because it takes us from recognition and descrip-
tion of a pattern to a search for an explanation of the observed facts. In this case, the expla-
nation is physiological, based on how we produce sounds in our vocal tracts. Since this is
a topic covered in the next chapter, we will not go into detail here. The important point is
that patterns in language can be explained by the function of language as a system
of human communication. In this case, the explanation comes from the embedding of
language in our human physiologies; in other cases, other aspects of the functional role of
language explain linguistic patterns.
Regular patterns such as this occur in every language many times and at many levels.
Some patterns are concerned exclusively with sounds, other patterns are found at other lev-
els, such as word structure or sentence structure. One of the fascinating aspects of language
is the interaction of these patterns, which at times can be quite complex. All the patterns in
a language that explicitly involve sounds make up the “sound system” or phonology of a
language; the patterns which involve word structure make up the morphology , while the
patterns which involve sentence structure make up the syntax. Each of these subsystems
of language is independent, but each is also interwoven with the others. In the example
above, both the phonology (in this case, which sound is pronounced where) and the mor-
phology (the past-tense suffix - ed ) are involved. The morphology and syntax of a language
are together referred to as the language’s grammar. For further discussion of the sub-areas
examined in linguistic analysis, see Textbox 1.2.
```

**11 1 Introduction**

### TEXTBOX 1.2 LINGUISTIC ANALYSIS

```
Many examples of systematicity in language will
be presented throughout the following chapters.
One of the goals of this book is to teach you how
to recognize and analyze systematic patterns in a
wide variety of languages, that is, how to perform
linguistic analysis. This requires learning the
common – and sometimes the rare – linguistic
categories that are found in the languages of the
world, the terminology that accompanies those
categories, and the theories underlying them.
Linguistic analysis requires logical thought, a clear
understanding of linguistic concepts, and concise
description and argumentation.
```
```
Once linguistic structures are accurately described,
the analysis is completed by explanation. The critical
question is: What motivates the linguistic structures to
be formed in precisely that way? This question goes
to the very core of linguistic theory. The answer will
depend crucially upon the particular structure being
explained. There are a number of distinct domains that
may contribute to it, including meaning ( semantics ),
how the structure is used in context ( function ), factors
related to history ( language change ), the physical
properties of sound ( phonetics ), and the structure
of the human brain and how we learn and process
knowledge ( neurology , cognition ).
```
```
On the other hand, no language is perfectly systematic. Although there are sometimes
patterns within patterns within patterns, there are often pieces that don’t fit into any regu-
lar pattern, but which have idiosyncratic, or irregular, behavior. This is in large part due to
language change. The irregularities are leftovers from older patterns that have been oblite-
rated, as new structures emerge and spread through the language.
As an example, consider the English verb shine. This verb is a bit irregular as it has two
forms of the past tense, shined and shone. The form shined is constructed by adding the
regular past-tense suffix to the verb stem and following the rule of past-tense formation
we just discovered ( shine ends in a D-List consonant). The form shone is a reflection of an
old pattern where past tense was indicated by changing the vowel in a verb’s root. This
pattern was inherited from an earlier stage in the language. It has largely died out, but
traces of it remain in a handful of verbs, especially those that are used frequently and are
therefore resistant to change (for example, take/took, drive/drove ). In the development of
English, the marking of past tense by - ed gradually spread through the vocabulary, sup-
planting the older forms. This process has not been completed with the verb shine , and
both past-tense forms coexist in the modern tongue. Thus, this irregularity of the lan-
guage has a historical explanation. Irregularities in language usually result from language
change.
```
```
1.2 Languages
1.2.1 Languages of the World Today
Languages are spoken – and signed (see Textbox 1.3) – across the globe. People are spread
over the earth from the tip of Tierra del Fuego to the Arctic North, and wherever there are
people, there are languages. Think for a minute about each of the continents and their
communities. How many languages do you think there are in the world?
```

**12 Carol Genetti**

### TEXTBOX 1.3 SIGN LANGUAGES

```
Sign languages are natural languages that have
arisen wherever deaf people have come together
to form a community. Ethnologue (2016) lists 138
sign languages in the world. Like spoken languages,
sign languages are structured, systematic, change
```
```
over time, and can be used to communicate all the
complex concepts that people convey to one another
over the course of a lifetime. Like spoken languages,
many sign languages are endangered and need
people to document them.
```
```
The question is more difficult than it first appears. The truthful answer is that we don’t
have an exact count, although we are able to make an educated guess. There are two pri-
mary reasons why counting up languages is tricky. One is that linguists haven’t identified
all the languages of the world yet. There are still speech (and sign-language) communities
that follow their traditional ways of life and who have had little interaction with larger
population groups or researchers. The languages of these groups are still undescribed.
However, there is also a more fundamental problem in counting up languages, which is
that it is difficult to decide which speech varieties should be counted as languages and
which should be counted as dialects of a single language.
Let’s consider possible criteria for distinguishing languages from dialects. One obvious
place to start is mutual intelligibility : Can the speakers of the two language varieties
understand each other? The criterion of mutual intelligibility, taken to its logical conclu-
sion, suggests that if they can understand each other, the two varieties are to be considered
dialects of a single language; if they cannot understand each other, the varieties are to be
considered distinct languages. One problem with this criterion is that there are often mul-
tiple varieties of a language, and while speakers of adjacent varieties can understand each
other, speakers of geographically separated varieties have a much harder time. This situa-
tion is schematized in Figure 1.1:
```
```
AB C DE
```
```
Figure 1.1 Schematization of language varieties
```
### SIDEBAR 1.3

```
For an example of a dialect
continuum, see the Seneca
Language Profile, Section LP13.1.
```
```
In Figure 1.1, each letter represents speakers of different varieties and the arrow represents
geographic distance. While speakers of A might easily understand speakers of B and C, it
might take effort to understand speakers of D, and it might be
quite difficult to converse with speakers of E. Similarly, speakers
of E might have no problem speaking with those of D and C but
might have more difficulty with speakers of A. So, are A and E
different languages? If so, where does one draw the dividing line?
This situation is known as a dialect continuum , and it repre-
sents a common situation throughout the world.
Of course, Figure 1.1 is highly idealized. Communities aren’t usually ranged along a
straight road with distinct boundaries, and there is often movement and intermarriage
```

**13 1 Introduction**

```
between the various groups. However, the problem remains of whether mutually unintelli-
gible A and E should be counted as one or two languages. We can see that the question itself
is overly simplistic and obscures the more complex reality of the dispersion of language
varieties and their speakers.
Another problem with the criterion of mutual intelligibility is the word “mutual.” This
implies that speakers of both speech communities are equally at ease or equally perplexed
when hearing the speech of the other. However, there are many cases of unidirectional intel-
ligibility, that is, speakers of Group A can understand the speech of Group B, but not the
other way around. This situation especially occurs when the Group A variety is spoken by
a minority group and the Group B variety is a standard language , taught in schools and
used in print and broadcast media. In this situation, the Group A speakers have repeated
exposure to the B variety and so can understand it. The Group B speakers, on the other
hand, may never have heard the speech of Group A, so they find it surprising and difficult.
It is not always clear whether these varieties are different dialects or different languages.
Another reason for the difficulty in counting up languages is that there is a complex
relationship between language and ethnic identity. Consider the case of the Newars, an
ethnic group which traditionally ruled the Kathmandu Valley in Nepal. While the largest
concentration of Newars is in the Kathmandu Valley itself, there are other Newar commu-
nities scattered throughout the country. One variety of Newar is spoken in a village called
Dolakha, quite a distance to the east. The Dolakha and Kathmandu speech varieties are
truly mutually unintelligible. People from these two Newar communities cannot speak to
each other in Newar but must use the national language Nepali to converse. If the question
of language versus dialect were to be based solely on mutual intelligibility, then these two
varieties would count as separate languages. However, the Dolakha Newars are ethnically
Newars in every sense of the word. They have the same customs, social structures, festivals,
and traditions, and they intermarry with Newars from other parts of Nepal. Crucially, their
language, even though mutually unintelligible with the other varieties, still serves to dis-
tinguish the group ethnically from non-Newars, so it is a marker of Newar ethnic identity.
The language is thus Newar in a very real and relevant sense to the speakers of the language
itself. The function of the language as a marker of ethnic identity would suggest that the
Dolakha variety is a Newar dialect, not an independent language. The criteria of mutual
intelligibility and ethnic identity thus lead us to different conclusions on the question of
language versus dialect.
The opposite situation can be found with Swedish and Norwegian, two of the Scandinavian
“languages.” These two speech varieties are easily mutually intelligible. However, a national
boundary and ethnic identity divide the two groups; hence, they
are considered to speak distinct languages rather than dialects of a
single language. Such circumstances motivated the famous quip by
the Yiddish linguist Max Weinreich: “A language is a dialect with an
army and a navy.” Sociopolitical and ethnic considerations clearly
have significant weight in the language/dialect debate.
While acknowledging that there are inherent difficulties in counting up the languages of
the world, we still want to know roughly how many there are. The most current compilation

of statistics on the world’s languages is found in Ethnologue: Languages of the World (available
online at http://www.ethnologue.com). My source for the statistics in the following discussion
is the internet version of the nineteenth edition (Lewis et al. 2016 ), which puts the total
number of known languages at 7,097. How close was that to your own estimate?
The distribution of languages across continents is given in Table 1.1 (note that “the
Americas” include North, South, and Central America, and “the Pacific” includes Australia,

New Zealand, and the Pacific Islands). Table 1.1 shows the number and percentage of the
world’s languages spoken or signed on each continent.
Note that the languages of Europe account for only 4 percent of the total number of lan-
guages of the world, while Asia and Africa have more than 30 percent each.
Table 1.2 presents statistics on the world’s languages in relation to the size of the speech
communities of native speakers.
Table 1.2 shows that there are very few languages with very large numbers of speak-
ers; only 5.6% of the world’s languages have more than a million speakers. On the other
hand, 53% of the world’s languages have fewer than 10,000 speakers. When we combine
these numbers with population statistics, the results are quite striking. Roughly 94% of
the world’s population speaks only 6% of its languages. The remaining 94% of the
languages are spread over only 6% of the population. Thus, we have a handful of
languages with enormous speech communities and a very large number of languages with
quite small speech communities.
```
```
1.2.2 Languages of the World Tomorrow
While there are around 7,000 languages spoken or signed on the globe today, not all lan-
guages are equally robust. Over time patterns of language use in multilingual communi-
ties can shift so that a socially dominant language comes to be used more frequently and
less-dominant languages are used in fewer social contexts and among fewer people. Such
languages are described as endangered , at risk of ceasing to be spoken in the absence of
conscious efforts to keep them vital. According to Ethnologue , about 35 percent of the

**16 Carol Genetti**

```
world’s languages can be classified as losing speakers or being further along the
endangerment process.
The endpoint of the language endangerment process is language death , which occurs
when a language ceases to have speakers and no longer serves as a symbolic marker of iden-
tity for the community. Normally the process of endangerment occurs gradually, over three
or more generations. It involves a cessation in language transmission , the passing on of
a language from one generation to the next. When children don’t learn the language, the
only remaining speakers are adults. That population naturally ages and declines until only
a handful of speakers remains. In the absence of community efforts to reverse the trend, the
language can cease to be spoken. If it ceases to be a cultural resource for the community, it
is classified as extinct. (For a discussion on what is lost when a language ceases to be spoken,
see Textbox 1.4.)
```
```
There are a number of reasons why languages become extinct. Sometimes the process of
language death has been brought about by explicit government policies designed to keep
children from learning their native language. However, language extinction is not limited
to communities targeted by such policies. Language endangerment and death appear to be
primarily fueled by the broader process of globalization, including a shift from agrarian to
urban lifestyles, and the increasing dominance of a small number of languages for the pur-
poses of commerce, education, and the media. These include both the truly widely spoken
languages, like Mandarin Chinese, English, Spanish, Hindi-Urdu, and Arabic, and smaller
national languages, like Nepali, Greek, Georgian, and Thai. Often acquisition of such lan-
guages is necessary for anyone wanting to pursue an advanced education or a career in
modern society. Thus, parents are under pressure to have their children educated in these
languages and therefore choose to transmit these languages as opposed to those of the her-
itage communities.
Another element that can contribute to the loss of a language is the loss of the coherence
and vitality of the speech community. If the members of a small speech community become
```
### TEXTBOX 1.4 WHAT IS LOST WHEN WE LOSE A LANGUAGE?

```
Does language death matter? Linguists and members
of many speech communities answer with a resounding
“yes.” Each language is a testament to the ways in which
a unique group of people has understood and interacted
with their environment and has come to terms with the
human condition. Each is a unique inheritance from
countless generations of forebears, the encapsulation of
their wisdom and knowledge. Each language reflects and
instantiates the culture of the speakers. Each contains
knowledge, traditions, and history. Each represents what
a language can be and so enriches our understanding of
this central aspect of our humanity.
```
```
“Surely, just as the extinction of any animal species
diminishes our world, so does the extinction of
any language. Surely we linguists know, and the
general public can sense, that any language is
a supreme achievement of a uniquely human
collective genius, as divine and endless a mystery
as a living organism. Should we mourn the loss of
Eyak or Ubyky any less than the loss of the panda or
California condor?”

Center)

```
absorbed into a larger group through intermarriage, the community can become dispersed.
Where there is no viable speech community, there is little reason to pass the language on to
the children; neither will the children hear the language spoken with sufficient frequency
to acquire it.
The recognition of the scope of the problem of language endangerment has led to sig-
nificant work by members of endangered-language speech communities and linguists to
record, preserve, and revitalize languages. Language documentation , the creation of
an extensive record of a language and its community, is an important part of this process.
Language conservation is also being undertaken in many communities, which are
developing materials to be used in the education of children and to promote language use
in the speech community. Language revitalization is undertaken by speech commu-
nities whose language has been entirely lost or significantly reduced. Such projects can do
much more than simply teach the language; they can play significant roles in strengthen-
ing communities and in promoting the preservation of traditional knowledge, practices,
cultural values, and institutions.

```
1.3 Linguistics
1.3.1 The Scientific Study of Language
Now that we have learned a bit about language and about the world’s languages, we turn
at last to the topic of linguistics. Linguistics is the scientific study of language. By
```

**18 Carol Genetti**

```
In linguistics, empirical data are recordings of spoken or written language, collected into
a corpus. The nature of the recordings and how they are collected will depend on the goals
of the study. For example, if one wishes to study the physical properties of sounds, the best
recordings might be those produced in the isolation of a sound booth. If one wishes to
study sentence structures and how they are used, the best recordings are likely to be natural
conversations or narratives, supplemented by the comments of native speakers that reflect
their intuitions about the structures and their meanings in that particular context. If one
is studying language and society, one might choose to make video recordings of authen-
tic interactions. In any case, recorded data, preferably of speech or writing produced in a
natural setting, and not constructed by or for a linguist, are
the most highly empirical and can be verified by subsequent
researchers. This is not to say that this is the only type of use-
ful data in linguistics. Speakers’ intuitions about their lan-
guage, particularly regarding subtle distinctions in meaning,
add a depth to our understanding that we could not possibly
obtain otherwise.
When we say that a science is objective, we mean that our analysis is not biased by any
preconceived notions, or judgments of “good” and “bad.” Human beings are prone to prej-
udice, and this can be directed at speakers of languages just as it is directed at ethnicities,
```
### TEXTBOX 1.5 LINGUIST VERSUS POLYGLOT

```
The longer you study linguistics, the more likely it is
that someone will ask you the question: “How many
languages do you speak?” This question illustrates
the commonly held misconception that linguists are
polyglots. It is important to distinguish between the
two. A linguist is a person who examines the structures
of languages and the principles underlying those
structures. A polyglot is a person who speaks many
languages. Many linguists are, indeed, polyglots, but
you don’t have to be a polyglot to study linguistics.
A nice analogy can be made to pilots and airplane
mechanics. A pilot knows how to fly an airplane, based
both on training and on an instinctive sense of flight
and how a plane responds to a particular manipulation
of the controls. An airplane mechanic looks inside a
```
```
plane and knows how each part contributes to the
workings of the whole. One doesn’t need to be an
airplane mechanic to be a pilot. Neither does one need
to be able to fly a plane in order to be a mechanic. A
linguist is like a mechanic, looking inside to see how the
parts of the language fit together so that the language
can function in human communication. The speaker
is the pilot, able to use the language efficiently and
effectively, but without necessarily knowing how it
works.
Probably the best airplane mechanics are also pilots,
and in the same way, the most insightful analysis of the
language will come from someone who speaks it, but a
linguist can make a tremendous amount of headway on
the analysis of a language without speaking it.

“scientific,” we mean that the study is both empirical (based on observable data) and
objective. Empirical data is critical for any scientific discipline, as it ensures that others
can verify or replicate the findings. The term linguist refers to a person who examines the
structures and principles underlying languages. Note that this is different from a polyglot ,
a person who speaks many languages. For more on this distinction, see Textbox 1.5.

```
religions, sexualities, styles of dress, or any other characteristic by which people are sub-
grouped. It is not uncommon to find languages described as “primitive,” “corrupt,” “illogi-
cal,” “ugly,” or just plain “bad.” By contrast, other languages can be described as “perfect,”
“logical,” or “beautiful.” To take an example from the United States, some speakers of
American English believe that the dialect of English spoken in certain African-American
communities (referred to as African-American English, or AAE) is “corrupt” or “ungram-
matical.” People with this view cite AAE sentences like She sick and She be sick , and claim
that they are “incorrect,” since they differ from the Standard American English sentence
She is sick. In actuality, AAE is making a grammatical distinction in these two sentences that
is not marked in the grammar of Standard American English. The sentence She sick refers
to a present situation; it simply states that the person is sick now. This sentence could be
used, for example, to explain why someone is unexpectedly absent. The sentence She be sick
means that she is often sick or has a long-term illness. The implication is that the illness
is ongoing and lasts for an extended period of time. This meaning distinction between a
present state and an ongoing state is systematically made by the grammar of AAE (as well as
by many other languages in the world). Of course, speakers of Standard American English
can still signal this meaning if they want to, for example, by using an adverb such as always ,
but its use is not grammatically required. This doesn’t mean that AAE is any “better” than
Standard American English; the two dialects are just different. Every language or dialect
is unique in the types of distinctions it makes. Every lan-
guage is equally able to convey all of the complex meanings
that humans communicate to each other in the course of a
lifetime. Languages differ in which distinctions they grammati-
cally require their speakers to make, and in which meanings can
be expressed by other, non-grammatical, means.
An important distinction can be made between prescriptive and descriptive approaches
to language. A prescriptive approach to language is one that teaches people the “proper
way” to speak or write. Many children are exposed to prescriptive grammar in school,
where they are taught, for example, not to split infinitives (e.g., to boldly go ) or to end
a noun phrase with a preposition (e.g., the man I saw you with ). Prescriptive grammari-
ans choose a set of forms that they enjoin others to adhere to. These forms represent a
(slightly) older stage of the language when the rules were regular, so the establishment of
prescriptive rules reflects a resistance to the natural forces of change. In actuality the set of
forms chosen for prescription are ultimately arbitrary; there is no logical reason why one
should not split an infinitive or end a sentence with a preposition. Prescriptive rules may
still have social ramifications, however, and there are environments (such as academic
writing) where ignoring these conventions can have negative social consequences (such
as lower grades).
A descriptive approach to language is one that describes how people actually use lan-
guage. Descriptivists are not interested in telling people what is right or wrong, but in
observing, describing, and explaining actual linguistic behavior. In line with the objective
nature of linguistic science, linguistics is a descriptive enterprise.

1.3.2 Fields of Linguistics

```
The field of linguistics is as broad and multifaceted as language itself. The following para-
graphs provide a very brief orientation to the primary subfields of the discipline. As in the
rest of this book, this presentation will take the traditional hierarchical approach to lan-
guage, beginning with the smallest units and working up to larger and larger levels.
We will begin with the study of speech sounds. The physical properties of sounds – how
they are articulated and perceived, and the acoustic signatures of the sounds themselves –
are the subject of study in the field of phonetics. We will then examine the systematic use
of speech sounds in language, or phonology.
```
### STOP AND REFLECT 1.3 VOWEL-LENGTH DIFFERENCES

```
Try saying the English words lack and lag. If you pay attention to your mouth and listen carefully, you will
notice that the vowels in these words are produced with the same tongue position, but that the vowel in lack
is a bit shorter than that in lag. This is a phonetic observation, which could be verified by measuring the vowel
durations in an acoustic display on a computer screen. Now say lake/leg, pick/pig , and lock/log ; you will find
that the vowel is always shorter before /k/ and longer before /g/. The same pattern is found before /p/ and
/b/ ( lap/lab ) and /t/ and /d/ ( fat/fad ). We see that these sounds pattern in a systematic way. Such systems of
sounds form the phonology of a language.
```
```
From the study of sounds we move to the study of words themselves. The ways in which
words are structured and created are the purview of the field of morphology. Morphologists
look at all the pieces of words (roots, prefixes, suffixes, etc.), their sounds and meanings,
and the principles of their combination. The study of how words combine into phrases,
clauses, and sentences is the study of syntax. Morphology and syntax are tightly inte-
grated and are often referred to as morphosyntax or (in some uses) grammar.
```
### STOP AND REFLECT 1.4 MARKERS OF NEGATION

```
Languages differ in how they mark negation. In some languages, markers of negation are independent
words (English not , Italian non ), while in others they are prefixes (Dolakha Newar ma-na ‘didn’t eat’), suffixes
(English didn’t ), or a combination (French n’est pas ). Think of another language that you are familiar with. Is
negation marked by an independent word or an affix?
Languages also differ in the number of negation markers they have. Wayampi, a language of northern
Brazil, has four markers of negation. The study of the forms, meanings, and uses of these markers falls under
the field of morphology.
```
```
A critical aspect of language that interacts with all of these levels is semantics , meaning
in language. The study of semantics includes the study of word meanings ( lexical seman-
tics ) and the study of how meanings combine in clauses and sentences ( propositional
semantics ).
When we look at how speakers use linguistic structures in larger stretches of speech, we
are studying discourse. This field takes into account the interactional nature of language,
for example, how speakers need to present their ideas in a way that allows hearers to under-
stand them. With the help of computers, linguists can now look at statistically significant
```

**21 1 Introduction**

```
patterns over very large sets, or corpora , of discourse data; this methodology is referred
to as corpus linguistics. The role of the broader context in interpreting linguistic form
and meaning is examined in the field of pragmatics. A large part of the context of speech
comes from its embedding in the society and culture of its speakers. This field of study is
sociocultural linguistics.
```
```
STOP AND REFLECT 1.5 CONVEYING AND INTERPRETING SOCIAL MEANINGS
You are studying in the library. Two people come in talking loudly. They sit at the table next to you and
continue to talk loudly about the party they went to. They ignore your glares and those of other people in
the room. Finally you say, “Hey, could you speak up? I missed that last part.” How is it that the people can
interpret this as a request to be quiet? The answer lies in the field of pragmatics.
```
```
Our linguistic capabilities are critically embedded in our neurology and our ability to
think. The field of language and the brain examines the physical and neurological
basis of language, while cognitive linguistics looks at how language is instantiated by
our broader cognitive processes. A related field is language acquisition , which studies
how language is learned by children ( first language acquisition) and by adults ( second
language acquisition ).
```
### TEXTBOX 1.6 HISTORICAL LINGUISTICS SHEDS LIGHT ON PREHISTORIC

### MIGRATIONS

```
Historical linguistics can tell us much about human
prehistory. In many cases, we can trace how populations
have migrated across the globe. For example, most of
the languages of the Athabascan family are spoken by
native communities located between the Yukon region
of Alaska down the Pacific coast of North America to
northern California. However one branch of the family,
```
```
which consists of Apache and Navajo, is spoken in the
southwest of the United States. Linguists were able to
use principles of historical linguistics to discover that
the Apachean languages are, indeed, members of
the Athabascan family, and to therefore deduce that
speakers migrated from the Pacific Northwest to the
American Southwest in a prehistoric time period.
```
```
The field of historical linguistics examines how languages change over time. This his-
torical perspective can be applied to all levels of language: sounds, words, structures, and
meanings. Historical linguists are also interested in determining which languages are related
and how they have descended from a mother language, which was spoken in the distant past
(see Textbox 1.6 for one such example). But languages don’t evolve in isolation. Instead, they
often influence each other as their speakers interact over time. The study of such language
contact is a subfield of historical linguistics.
```
```
Computational linguistics is a field at the intersection of linguistics and computer
science that deals with the statistical or rule-based modeling of natural language. It is con-
cerned with applying methods from artificial intelligence and machine learning to prob-
lems involving language. The recent acceleration of our technological abilities has led to a
greater application of computational methods to a wide range of linguistic questions, such
as how languages are learned.
```

### TEXTBOX 1.7 ORDERINGS OF SUBJECTS, VERBS, AND OBJECTS ACROSS THE

### GLOBE

```
When we look at sentence structures across languages,
we notice that languages differ in the relative ordering
of the subject ( Chris in Chris ate the apple ), the object
( the apple ), and the verb ( ate ). There are six logically
possible orderings of these three categories:
Subject-Object-Verb Subject-Verb-Object
Object-Subject-Verb Object-Verb-Subject
Verb-Subject-Object Verb-Object-Subject
```
```
However, all six orderings are not equally instantiated
in the world’s languages. A famous study of these
orderings found that languages which put the subject
first are very common, those that put the verb first
are much less common, and those that put the object
first are very few indeed. Why this should be, and
the theoretical implications of this fact, is a question
addressed in linguistic typology.
```
```
We find languages throughout the world. The field of linguistic typology looks at
how the world’s languages are similar and different. See Textbox 1.7 for an example of this.
Typologists are interested in developing a classification of languages based on how they are
structured, and in looking for relationships between certain structural language types.
There are many applications of linguistics to situations in the world around us. The field
of applied linguistics includes a number of subfields, including language teaching and
forensic linguistics. Recently, there has been a strong move toward language docu-
mentation , the creation of a record of a language that can be used by speech communities
and others in the face of possible endangerment or language death. Of course, linguistics
is also a key part of the field of speech pathology and speech and hearing sciences.
Thus, the study of linguistics can lead to a wide range of careers, as discussed in Textbox 1.8.
This list of subfields of linguistics is fairly representative but is certainly not exhaustive.
While we will not be able to touch on all of these fields in this book, we will cover most of
them. The fields are diverse enough that there is usually something to interest everyone,
and some readers will find that they are interested in everything.
```
### TEXTBOX 1.8 LINGUISTICS AS A GATEWAY TO CAREERS

```
Because language is a pervasive aspect of human
life, a degree in linguistics can lead to a wide variety
of careers. Linguistics majors develop important
professional skills that would be valued by any
employer: data analysis, reasoning, argumentation,
communication, writing, cultural sensitivity, and an
appreciation of diversity. Many linguistics students
also gain experience in teamwork, collaboration, and
leadership, and many speak multiple languages.
A background in linguistics is especially well
suited for speech pathology (which trains speech
```
```
therapists to work with children or adults with
speech disorders), language teaching, and speech
technologies. Linguistics students also go on to
careers in translation, education, law, government,
journalism, publishing, lexicography, and a wide
variety of industries, including marketing and data
analytics. Many students also go on to doctoral study
in linguistics, anthropology, psychology, or related
fields, which opens the door to research and teaching
at the college and university level, in addition to the
careers listed above.
```

**23 1 Introduction**

### CHAPTER SUMMARY

```
Human languages are complex, structured, and dynamic systems of human
communication, which change over time under a variety of influences. While it is
impossible to exactly count the number of languages of the world, our current estimate
is in the range of 7,000. However, these are not evenly distributed, as most of the world’s
population speaks one or more of a small number of dominant languages, while a small
percentage of the population speak one of many languages with comparatively few
speakers, many of which are endangered.
Linguistics is the scientific study of language. It is empirical and objective. Linguists
seek to describe succinctly the structural properties of languages, and to understand their
interactions, how they change, and how they serve the broader functions of language as
a tool of communication that is embedded in human physiology, cognition, interaction,
society, and culture. Explaining how individual languages work and how language works
more broadly constitutes the aim of linguistic theory.

```
**4.** Go to the website _International Dialects of English Archive_ (www.dialectsarchive.com) and click on the global
    map. Each of the pointers indicates a profile of a speaker of English; click on the pointer to bring up a box
    with metadata on the profile: title, speaker age, location, etc. Click on the title in this box (e.g., “Russia 13”)
    to bring up the full profile page. Each profile includes a sound file, beginning with the speaker reading a short
    passage and then transitioning to talking informally about themselves.
       Explore the site and choose six profiles, one from each of the following countries: Canada, the United
    Kingdom, China, Jamaica, Mexico, and Zimbabwe. For each profile, list the following: the title of the
    profile and the gender, age, birthplace, and educational background of the speaker. Listen to each sound
    file in full and record any observations you can make on the sounds, words, or grammatical features.
**5.** Go to the website of the _UNESCO Atlas of the World’s Languages in Danger_. (www.unesco.org/languages-
    atlas) The top left box of the search tools allows you to select a country or area. The number of
    endangered languages in each country or area is given in parentheses. When you choose one and click on
    “Search Languages,” a map of the country will be displayed with the location of the endangered languages
    indicated by markers. The color of the marker indicates the endangerment status of the language, as
    indicated by the key to the right above the map. The particular languages are given in alphabetical order
    to the right of the map.

       bring up a box with basic information about the language. List the number of speakers and the given
       endangerment status for each of the following languages: (i) Nez Perce, (ii) Central Alaskan Yup’ik (not
       the one on Nunivak Island), (iii) Cherokee, (iv) Barbareño (Chumash), (v) Hawai‘ian, and (vi) O’Odham
       (Tohono).
    **c.** Using the map, choose four other languages of varying endangerment statuses. List their names,
       populations, and statuses.


**25 1 Introduction**

**6.** Find a speaker of a language with which you are unfamiliar. Ask this person to translate the following
    sentence. Be sure to ask for the most natural way to express the meaning, rather than a word-by-word
    translation of the English.
_My two aunts will fly back tomorrow and I will meet them at the airport._
    **a.** Ask the speaker to help you sound out the sentence and write it down (you don’t have all the skills you
       need for this yet, but just do your best).
    **b.** Compare the English sentence with the sentence in the language of your study. Make a list of any
       differences that you find between the two languages. For example, they may differ in the number
       of words used, the order in which they appear, in how they signal future tense, in which words have
       prefixes or suffixes and what those mean, in the meanings of specific words, in whether or not they use
       “and” to join sentences, etc.
    **c.** In submitting your answer, state the language of study and where it is spoken, include your
       transcription of the sentence in the other language, and list as many differences as you can find.
**7.** Assume you were enrolled in a class that you found frustrating and in which you were not doing well.
    Write down how you would express this in one or two sentences to your best friend, to your parents, and
    to your college dean (e.g., on a petition to drop the course). Note down any differences in your choice of
    words. How is this illustrative of the relationship of language and societal structure?

    choose the English language version) and answer the following questions:
    **a.** Where is Sami spoken?
    **b.** What languages is Sami related to?
    **c.** Does Sami have distinct dialects?
    **d.** What does the author mean when she describes Sami as a “nature-based” language? What might be
       the value of documenting a language of this type?
    **e.** What percentage of Sami speakers now speak the language?
    **f.** Why has the vitality of the language declined?
    **g.** Why is it important to focus revitalization activities on Sami children?

### CHAPTER PREVIEW

```
Phonetics is the branch of linguistics that is concerned with the scientific study of speech
sounds. The study of phonetics can provide answers to many questions that you might have
wondered about at one time or another. For example, what does it mean to say that someone
has a higher-pitched voice than someone else? What makes a tone language like Mandarin
Chinese different from a non-tonal language such as English or Spanish? How do English pairs
of words such as the verb import and the noun import differ?
Several areas of phonetics have been the focus of research into the features of speech.
Articulatory phonetics is concerned with how the vocal organs produce speech. Acoustic
phonetics deals with the physical characteristics of speech, such as the duration, frequency,
and intensity of sounds. Auditory phonetics examines the perception of speech by the
auditory system. Acoustic, articulatory, and auditory phonetics are all interrelated, since
changing the articulatory configuration of the vocal tract results in acoustic changes which
in turn potentially influence the perception of a sound. In this chapter, we will consider the
first of these areas of phonetic research, providing an overview of the field as well as answers
to the questions posed above. Students will be introduced to the tasks of discerning different
speech sounds, describing them in phonetic terms, and accurately recording them using the
International Phonetic Alphabet.

2.1 **The Speech Organs**

```
The physical production of speech requires intricate coordination between several
parts of the upper body, from the stomach all the way up to the nose. It is common to
divide the speech organs into three subsystems (see Figure 2.1): the subglottal system, the
larynx, and the supralaryngeal (or supraglottal) system.

**28 Matthew Gordon**

2.1.1 The Subglottal System

```
The subglottal system includes the lungs and the trachea (or windpipe), which provide
the air that the upstream articulators manipulate to produce sound. The lungs function
like balloons, recoiling after inspiration and setting the air molecules in the vocal tract in
motion.
```
2.1.2 The Larynx

```
Moving up from the lungs and trachea, the larynx is the source for many of the sounds
produced in speech. It is located behind the thyroid cartilage (or Adam’s apple), which is
the bump you can feel on the front of the neck if
you lean your head back. The larynx contains two
vocal folds that vibrate during voiced sounds
such as z or v. To feel the vocal folds vibrate, try
placing your fingers on the thyroid cartilage in the
front of your neck while making a prolonged [zzzzzz]
sound. You will feel the cartilage vibrating. Compare
this to what happens when you make a long [ssssss]
sound. There is no vibration. Vocal fold vibration,
otherwise known as voicing , does not require any
active motion beyond positioning the vocal folds
close enough together that the passage of air between
them causes them to vibrate. As long as the air pres-
sure below the larynx is less than the pressure above
the larynx, you can sustain a voiced sound. When
you produce the sound [zzzzz], you are producing a
voiced consonant.
As you have already learned when you made the
[ssssss] sound, it is also possible to make the same
sounds without vocal fold vibration, in which case,
you produce a voiceless consonant. For example,
by turning off voicing in z you get s and by turn-
ing off voicing during v you get f. (See Sidebar 2.3.)
Physically, devoicing of these sounds is achieved
by opening the larynx wider than for their voiced
counterparts.
In English there are two sounds that only
involve the larynx and not any articulators
above the larynx. One is the h sound in words like
hat or ahead. The other is the glottal stop found in
the middle of the expression uh-oh. Try saying uh -
oh emphatically while your hand is on your larynx
and your head is leaned back. You will feel an abrupt
```
### SIDEBAR 2.2

```
For a description of some of the ways people can
modify a normal speaking voice, most often with
effects produced in the larynx, see Section 10.3.
Note : Throughout the rest of the book, sidebars
like this one will cross-reference sections or
textboxes in other chapters or language profiles.
For example, “Section 10.3” refers to the third
section in Chapter 10 (Prosody). Other sidebars
might mention a section number that starts with
“LP” (Language Profile), e.g., “Section LP8.1”
refers to the first section of the Bardi Language
Profile (LP8), and “Textbox LP8.4” refers to the
fourth textbox in the Bardi Language Profile.
```
### SIDEBAR 2.3

```
In phonetics (and other linguistic fields) it is
important to distinguish between how a sound
is spelled, the orthography , and how it is
phonetically transcribed. In this chapter, we will
initially use italics to represent words and sounds
orthographically. Phonetic transcription, which is
written between square brackets, is introduced
later in the chapter.
```
### SIDEBAR 2.1

```
You can find definitions for key terms and bolded
terms throughout this chapter in the Glossary (at
the back of this book or on the student resources
website). Additional online resources for this
chapter include a study guide, accompanying
audio files, a review quiz, an articulators quiz,
vocabulary quizzes, IPA flashcards, an interactive
IPA chart with audio, and a phonetic transcription
exercise.

**29 2 Phonetics**

```
stoppage of voicing during the glottal stop between the two vowels as the vocal folds come
together to block off all airflow through the larynx. This is called a glottal stop , as you
stop the airflow by closing the glottis (the space between the vocal folds).
By adjusting the tension of the vocal folds during voicing, you can change the
fundamental frequency, and hence the pitch, of a sound. The fundamental frequency
of a sound is commonly referred to as pitch, though the two terms are technically not syn-
onymous. Fundamental frequency refers to the physical property of rate of vocal fold
vibration, whereas pitch refers to the perception of the sound on a scale of low to high.
Increasing fundamental frequency also typically increases the pitch. Someone with a rela-
tively high-pitched voice thus has a relatively high fundamental frequency or a fast rate of
vocal fold vibration. Conversely, someone with a low-pitched voiced has a relatively slow
rate of vocal fold vibration. Try making the sound [ahhhhhh]. Now try raising the pitch of
the sound while your fingers are on your larynx. You will feel the larynx tense up and rise.
Now try lowering the pitch of the sound. You will feel the larynx relax and lower. In this
way, you can see how an individual can easily change the fundamental frequency of his or
her voice.
```
```
2.1.3 The Supralaryngeal Vocal Tract and Place of Articulation
Above the larynx is the supralaryngeal vocal tract , which contains most of the struc-
tures that are manipulated in speech. The articulators of the supralaryngeal vocal tract are
shown in Figure 2.2. When you use different articulators to produce speech sounds, you are
changing the place of articulation of the sound.
In discussing different places of articulation, it is useful to move from the front to the
back of the mouth (see Figure 2.2), starting with the most visible organs. The lips play an
important role in producing many sounds, including p, b, m, w, f , and v in English. Sounds
that involve a narrowing or a complete closure of the upper and lower lip are called bilabi-
als. The bilabial sounds of English include p, b, m , and w. Sounds involving the upper teeth
and the lower lip are referred to as labiodentals. These include f and v. For labiodentals,
the lower lip is the active articulator , since it moves to meet the upper teeth. The upper
teeth are thus the passive articulator , since they are stationary. Most consonant articu-
lations involve both an active and a passive articulator. As we will see, for most consonants,
the tongue is the active articulator, while the upper surface of the mouth is the passive
articulator.
The structures just behind the lips are relatively immobile compared to the lips. These
rigid structures include the teeth, the alveolar ridge (the hard ridge just behind the teeth
before the upper surface of the mouth becomes more domed in shape), and the hard pal-
ate (the domed part of the roof of the mouth). The teeth are involved in the production
of the English th sounds in the words think and this. These sounds are produced by either
sticking the tip of the tongue between the upper and lower teeth, in which case the sounds
are said to be interdental , or placing the tip of the tongue against the back of the upper
teeth, in which case the sounds are simply called dentals. Try saying think with an inter-
dental th and then with a dental th. In order to make the comparison fair, be careful that
you are not completely blocking air from leaving the mouth when making the dental th.
```

You will not notice much of a difference in the sound from making this small articulatory
adjustment.
You may notice that the first sounds of think and this are different even though they
are both spelled as th. The two versions of th differ in voicing, just as z and s were shown
earlier to do: the th in think is voiceless, whereas the th in this is voiced. We will see shortly
that there is a system for transcribing speech in which the voiceless and the voiced th are
represented differently.

Just behind the teeth is the alveolar ridge, which is the contact point between the tongue
and the roof of the mouth for several sounds, including t (a voiceless sound), d (voiced), s
(voiceless), z (voiced), n (voiced), and l (voiced). Another sound r (voiced) is also typically
assigned to this same group, since r is produced with a narrowing in the vocal tract below
the alveolar ridge, even though the tongue may be raised only slightly toward the roof of
the mouth without touching it. See Stop and Reflect 2.1 for more discussion of alveolar
sounds.
There are also sounds that are produced with the tongue contacting the area just behind
the alveolar ridge. These are the postalveolar (or palato-alveolar ) sounds, which include
the sh sound in ship (which is a voiceless postalveolar) and the last sound in rouge (which
is a voiced postalveolar), as well as the first sounds in jug (voiced) and chug (voiceless). To
understand the relationship between alveolars and postalveolars, make an sss sound and
then switch to a shh sound. You will feel the tongue sliding backwards along the upper
surface of the mouth as it moves from an alveolar to a postalveolar place of articulation.
Sounds involving contact with the roof of the mouth in the center of the hard palate are
simply termed palatals. English has a single palatal sound: the y sound in words like yellow
and young.
Now drag your tongue backwards from the hard palate. You will notice that the upper
surface of the mouth becomes softer. This area of the mouth is called the soft palate , or
velum. Sounds produced by contacting the tongue and the soft palate are termed velars.
These include the k (a voiceless velar sound) in words like cat, bucket , and crib , the g (a
voiced velar) in words like gas, go , and bag , and the final ng sound (voiced) in words like sing
and lung. The sound w also involves some raising of the back of the tongue toward the soft
palate in addition to rounding of the lips; for this reason w is often labeled a labial-velar.
The soft palate, or velum, is important for distinguishing sounds involving airflow
through the nose and those lacking nasal airflow. Try looking in the mirror while saying
ah and you will see the velum rise. This raising of the velum ensures that no air escapes
through the nose while you are producing the vowel. To see this, hold your finger under
your nose while saying ah. Now try lowering the velum, holding the same tongue position
for ah while your finger is still in place under your nose. You will feel air passing through
your nose and will hear a nasal-sounding ahn , which is found in many languages of the
world, such as French.
```
### STOP AND REFLECT 2.1 TONGUE POSITION AND ALVEOLAR SOUNDS

```
You may note that not all of the alveolar sounds have the exact same point of contact for your tongue. This
type of variation is quite common; in particular, l often involves quite a bit of contact with the back of the
upper teeth, at least for many speakers of American English. Try making an extended [llll] sound and feel
where the tip of the tongue is contacting the upper surface of the mouth. Now try making a [nnnnnn]
sound and feel where the contact is. Does it occur at the same place as for the [llllll] sound? Even if there is a
difference, you should be aware that it is common for t, d, n , and l to all be treated as alveolars in discussing
the sounds of English.
```

**32 Matthew Gordon**

```
English also has nasal sounds, but they are consonants rather than vowels. Place your
finger under your nose while you are making the sounds m, n , and the ng sound in sing and
lung. You will feel air passing through your nose. Nasality is a separate dimension from place
of articulation, since sounds can have the same place of articulation but differ in whether
they are nasal or non-nasal (i.e., oral ). The sounds m and b differ in nasality; both are
voiced and both are bilabial, but only m is nasal. Try saying an [m] with your finger under
your nose and then immediately switch to a [b]. You will feel airflow through the nose
during the [m] but not during the [b] even though the lips remain closed throughout both
sounds. The sounds n and d also differ only in nasality; n is nasal and d is oral. Similarly, ng
and g differ in nasality; ng is the nasal member of the pair. Note that it is common to omit
the term oral when describing oral sounds, since oral is assumed to be the default case. (See
also Stop and Reflect 2.2 for a brief discussion of nasals and voicing.)
```
### STOP AND REFLECT 2.2 NASAL SOUNDS

```
In most languages all nasals are voiced, since it is difficult to produce a voiceless nasal that is clearly audible.
Try making an [m] sound and then turning off vocal fold vibration. You will wind up with a voiceless nasal,
which sounds identical to the sound made when breathing through your nose.
Practice producing voiced and voiceless nasals and listen to how they sound. You will notice that it is much
harder to hear a voiceless nasal than a voiced nasal. Although they are rare in the world’s languages, voiceless
nasals are found as consonants in some languages, such as Burmese.
Audio recordings of voiceless nasals in Burmese
```
2.2 **Manner of Articulation**

```
Thus far we have discussed three dimensions relevant for describing speech sounds: the
voicing dimension (voiced vs. voiceless), the place of articulation dimension, and the nasal-
ity dimension (nasal vs. oral). There is one other dimension that we must consider: the
narrowness of the constriction in the vocal tract. Differences in constriction narrowness are
referred to as differences in manner of articulation.
Some sounds involve a complete closure of the vocal tract. These are called stops.
English stops include p, b, m, t, d, n, k, g , and the ng sound. Of these sounds, p, b, t, d, k , and
g are oral stops since there is no nasal airflow, while m, n , and ng are nasal stops. All stops
involve two phases: a closure phase, during which the airflow through the mouth is com-
pletely blocked, and a release phase, when the constriction is released. To see this, produce
just the closure for the voiceless stop t without releasing the tongue from the alveolar ridge.
You will notice that there is complete silence, since there is no voicing. This means that
voiceless stops are only identifiable through their release, which provides crucial informa-
tion about place of articulation. There is another type of sound found in certain varieties of
English, including for most speakers of American and Australian English, that resembles an
alveolar stop in that it is produced with a complete closure at the alveolar ridge. This sound
is called a flap and occurs in the middle of words like pity, butter, lady , and ladder. The key
difference between a stop and a flap (sometimes also referred to as a tap ) is the extreme
```

**33 2 Phonetics**

```
shortness of the closure for the flap. The tongue briefly taps the roof of the mouth before
rapidly returning to position for the following sound.
It is also possible to produce sounds in which the two articulators are close
together, but not so tightly occluded that no air can escape through the mouth.
Sounds produced by a tight narrowing of articulators are termed fricatives. Fricatives are
characterized by turbulence created through the random collision of air molecules either at
the constriction location or, in the case of alveolar or postalveolar fricatives, by funneling
air to hit the back of the teeth. Try making an emphatic [ssssss] sound while holding your
hand palm down against your chin. You will feel air striking the back of your hand because
the air is being directed downward after it hits the back of your upper teeth. You will also
feel air striking your hand if you produce a prolonged and emphatic sh sound. Now try
making a [hhhhhh] sound while holding your hand in the same position. You will not feel
any air striking your hand. This is because the noise in [hhhhhh] is being produced directly
in the larynx and not by directing air against the back of the teeth. You will also notice that
the noise of h is much quieter than that associated with s or sh. Sounds like s and sh , which
involve funneling of air against the back of the teeth are particularly noisy. These sounds
are called stridents.
There are two sounds in English that are produced by combining a stop with a
following fricative in rapid succession. These are the affricates , which include the j
sound in jug (which is voiced) and the ch sounds word-initially and word-finally in church
(which are voiceless). Since affricates have a stop phase, they are often grouped together
with other stops.
Additionally, sounds can be produced through a slight narrowing of the vocal
tract, but not enough to cause noise or a complete obstruction. These sounds are
called approximants. Approximants in English include the y sound in yellow and the w
sound in water. Also included in the class of approximants in English is the r sound in words
like red, brick , and car.
A final approximant to consider is the sound l , which resembles t and d in involving
a complete closure in the middle of the alveolar ridge. There is, however, a crucial dif-
ference between l and these other sounds (besides the fact that l differs from t in being
voiced). The l sound is produced with a closure only in the center of the mouth.
At least one side of the tongue (if not both, depending on the speaker) is pulled down
slightly, away from the roof of the mouth. The lowering of the side part of the tongue
allows air to escape the mouth, whereas the true stops t and d have a complete closure
around the upper surface of the mouth. Try making an [llllll] sound and put your hand
first on the left side of the mouth and then on the right side. Is the air escaping from just
one or both sides of the mouth? The sound l has a lateral articulation in opposition to all
of the other sounds of English, which have central articulations. Note that it is common
to omit the term central when describing central sounds, since central is assumed to be
the default case.
There are a couple of additional useful terms for grouping together certain types of
sounds. One of these is the term liquids , which includes lateral approximants and r -type
sounds. Another common descriptor is the term obstruent , which refers to the combined
```

**34 Matthew Gordon**

```
set of oral stops and fricatives. Sounds that are not obstruents are the sonorants , which
include the nasals and all of the approximants, both lateral and central.
It is important to recognize that our discussion of places and manner of articulation has
focused on sounds occurring in English. In reality, there are many more sounds found in
languages other than English, as you know already if you speak or have studied other lan-
guages. Some of these sounds are discussed below.
```
2.3 **The International Phonetic Alphabet**

```
Up to now, we have referred to the different sounds of English using the traditional symbols
used in English spelling. While this strategy has worked for the most part, there are some
limitations of using spelling (orthographic) characters to represent sounds. One
problem we have already encountered concerns the English letters th , which can represent
either a voiceless dental fricative as in think or a voiced dental fricative as in this. Another
issue is the use of two letters to represent a single sound in English. For example, the voiced
velar nasal at the end of sing is represented by the combination ng. Similarly, the voiceless
postalveolar fricative is written as the sequence sh. While it is possible to use two letters to
represent a single sound, it is more efficient to use a single symbol to represent a sound that
behaves phonetically as a single entity. Furthermore, there is the potential for confusion
between a single phonetic sound written with two letters and a sequence of two phonetic
sounds also written with two letters. For example, if one sees ng , how can one be sure with-
out listening to the word, whether ng refers to a single voiced velar nasal, or the phonetic
sequence n (voiced alveolar nasal) plus g (voiced velar oral stop), as occurs in a careful pro-
nunciation of the compound rain gauge?
There is an even more serious problem with the use of English spelling to represent pho-
netic sounds. Many individual English letters or combinations of letters represent multiple
phonetic sounds depending on the particular word. For exam-
ple, the letter x can represent either a voiced alveolar fricative, z ,
as in xylophone , or the phonetic sequence of voiceless velar stop,
k , plus voiceless alveolar fricative, s , as in ox. Similarly, the letter
o has three different qualities in the words ton, pond , and drone.
Using orthography to represent phonetic pronunciation is thus
bound to cause confusion.
Fortunately, this problem is remedied by the existence of a special phonetic alphabet
designed to reflect pronunciation: the International Phonetic Alphabet, abbreviated IPA.
A crucial principle guiding the International Phonetic Alphabet is its universal
one-to-one correspondence between symbols and pronunciation. Thus, whenever
you see an IPA symbol, you can be sure of its pronunciation, regardless of the language
being transcribed. For example, whenever you see an IPA m , it will refer to a voiced bila-
bial nasal stop in any language. The IPA thus provides a useful tool for linguists who are
transcribing words and who plan to share these transcriptions with other researchers.
It is not the case, however, that all linguistic data are transcribed in IPA at all times; see
Textbox 2.1.
```
### SIDEBAR 2.4

of orthographic systems, see the
Indonesian Language Profile, Section
LP12.4.1 and Textbox LP12.4.
```

**35 2 Phonetics**

```
As it happens, the IPA bears close resemblance to English orthography in many respects.
There are only a few major points of departure between the two systems. First, the IPA sym-
bol for a voiceless (inter)dental fricative (as in think ) is [ș]
(IPA symbols will henceforth be written in brackets), while
the symbol for its voiced counterpart (as in this ) is [ð]. The
IPA symbol for a voiceless postalveolar fricative (as in ship ) is
[∫], while the symbol for its voiced counterpart (as in rouge )
is [ݤ]. The IPA represents the voiceless postalveolar affricate
(as in church ) as [t∫] and the voiced postalveolar affricate (as
in jug ) as [dݤ]. The IPA symbol for a voiced velar nasal stop
(as in sing ) is [ŋ]. The IPA symbol for glottal stop (as in uh-oh )
looks like a question mark but with a horizontal base rather
than a period [ݦ]. In addition, the IPA symbol for a voiced
palatal approximant (as in young ) is [j], while the symbol for
a central alveolar approximant (as in red ) is an upside-down
[݋]. Finally, the flap occurring in American English in the
middle of words like city and buddy is represented with the
symbol [ɾ].
We are now ready to see the entire list of IPA consonant symbols relevant for describing
English in Table 2.1.
In the chart, places of articulation appear as columns across the top of the chart, while
manner, nasality, and lateralness are captured in rows. Sounds differing only in voicing are
adjacent with the voiceless sound on the left and the voiced counterpart on the right. There
are many possible combinations where no consonant is represented; this reflects the lack
of such sounds in English, but does not mean that they are unattested in other languages.
Note that [w] appears in both the bilabial and the velar columns, since, as we have seen, it
involves constrictions simultaneously at the lips and at the velum. The flap [ɾ] appears in
parentheses reflecting the fact that it is present for only certain varieties of English, such as
American and Australian English.
```
### TEXTBOX 2.1 THE IPA AND REGIONAL TRANSCRIPTION PRACTICES

```
As noted, the IPA has been designed to transcribe the
sounds of every spoken language. However, it is not
the case that all linguists use the IPA at all times. In
many parts of the world, the transcription practices of
linguists reflect the orthographic practices of the local
region. In some cases, particular orthographic practices
are widespread in a given region, such as the use of the
symbol š in the transcription of North American Indian
languages for the sound written with “sh” in English
spelling and transcribed as [∫] in IPA.
```
```
In this volume, which takes data from many sources –
historical and contemporary – from all over the world,
the transcription system of the original source is used.
Interpreting transcriptions requires careful attention;
transcription notes are provided throughout the book
to aid readers in this task. Learning these different
systems, and how to interpret a variety of transcription
practices, is part of the task of learning linguistics.

As the tables show, the dimensions used to describe vowels differ from those used to
classify consonants. Vowels can be described in terms of three core dimensions: back-
ness, height, and tenseness. In addition, vowels can differ in whether they are produced
with lip rounding, as with the vowel in boat , or not, as with the vowel in beet.
There are three degrees of height in English: high, mid, and low. Example words illus-
trating the vowels of American and British English are shown in Tables 2.4 and 2.5, respec-
tively. The mid-central vowel [ə], also known as schwa , is confined to unstressed syllables
in English. It is pronounced with a higher tongue position than the mid-central vowel [ʌ],
which is only found in stressed syllables (you can hear both of these vowels in the word
above ; the first is [ə] and the second is [ʌ]).
```
```
There are also IPA symbols for vowels. Vowels fundamentally differ from conso-
nants in being produced with a relatively open vocal tract , though of course there
is some movement of the tongue necessary to make different vowel sounds. The IPA
chart for American English appears in Table 2.2 followed, in Table 2.3, by its counterpart
for the variety of British English commonly referred to as BBC English.

Vowels can also be described in terms of backness. The front vowels of English are [i,
ɪ, e, ɛ, æ]. The back vowels of English (both dialects combined) are [u, ʊ, o, ɔ, ɑ, ɒ], while
the central vowels are [ə, ɜ, ʌ, a]. Several of the back and central vowels vary considerably
between dialects and between speakers in their pronunciation (Textbook 2.2). The vowel [a]
for American English speakers varies widely in its backness from speaker to speaker, so you
may note that you have a somewhat backer pronunciation than central [a]. British English

TEXTBOX 2.2 [ ɔ ] AND [ a ] IN AMERICAN ENGLISH
```
```
Many speakers of American English, including most
from California, lack the vowel [ɔ]. For speakers who do
not have [ɔ], it is because it has merged with the low
vowel [a]. Speakers who have undergone this merger
typically (at least in California) produce a low central
vowel in words like caught, dawn , and law. Speakers
who have a contrast between [ɔ] and [a] have pairs of
words differing only in the vowel, e.g., caught with [ɔ]
```
```
versus cot with [a] and dawn with [ɔ] versus don with
[a]. Try asking several Americans to say the words cot
and caught. Do any of them have a different vowel in
the two words? Now try asking a speaker from Great
Britain how they pronounce these words. How does
their pronunciation compare with yours?

has a low back unrounded [ɑ] that corresponds to American English [æ] in words like half
and to American English [a] in words like father. British English also has a low back rounded
[ܥ] that corresponds to American English [a] in words like hot and pot. And British English
has an additional central vowel in words like purr and learn that corresponds to a syllabic [ɹ̩]
or rhotacized (i.e., r-colored) schwa [ɚ] (see Textbox 2.3) in American English.
Vowels can also differ in terms of their tenseness. There are several pairs of vowels in
English differing only in tenseness. For example, the pair of vowels [i] as in seat , and [ɪ]
as sit differ along this dimension; [i] is a tense vowel and [ɪ] is a lax vowel. Similarly, [e] is
tense and [ɛ] is lax, [u] is tense and [ʊ] is lax, [o] is tense and [ɔ] is lax, and [ɜ] is tense and
[ə] is lax. Tense vowels in English are longer than their lax counterparts and, for front and
back vowels, also typically have a slightly more peripheral tongue position (i.e., higher and
fronter in the case of front vowels, and higher and backer in the case of back vowels). You
can verify this by producing an [i] sound and then changing it to an [ɪ]. You will feel the
tongue lowering slightly and retracting. Now try the same exercise by switching from [e] to
[ɛ]; you will once again notice the tongue lowering and retracting.
The final parameter along which English vowels can be described is whether they are
produced with lip rounding or not. The rounded back vowels of English are [u, ʊ, o, ɔ, ɒ],
whereas [ɑ] is unrounded. All the front and central vowels in English are unrounded. To see
that rounding is a separate parameter from tongue height and backness , try making
an [i] sound while looking in the mirror. You will notice that the corners of the mouth are
drawn back and that there is no lip rounding. Now without moving your tongue, round
your lips by protruding them. The sound you wind up producing is a high tense front
rounded vowel, a sound that does not occur in English but that is found in many languages
of the world, such as German and French. As a point of interest, this sound is transcribed as
[y] in the IPA. This is why we use [j] and not the [y] symbol to transcribe the palatal approx-
imant found in English words like yam and yellow.
```
```
TEXTBOX 2.3 VOWELS BEFORE “r” IN ENGLISH
```
```
Combinations of vowels plus “r” in English tend to be
pronounced very differently from other vowel-plus-
consonant sequences. Speakers of many dialects drop
the “r” entirely at the end of a word or syllable, as in
the stereotypical pronunciation of the phrase [pak
ðə ka ɪn ޖhavəd jad] ‘Park the car in Harvard Yard’
by speakers of Boston or British English. After certain
vowels, as we have seen, the “r” may leave a residual
schwa-like vowel that combines with the preceding
```
```
vowel to form a diphthong as in the words peer, pear ,
and poor , as produced by speakers of British English.
The number of vowels occurring before “r” (where it
survives) is also typically reduced. Many speakers of
American English thus have only one or two of the
vowels [e, ɛ, æ] before “r”. The words Mary, merry , and
marry are homophonous for many people, as are the
names Karen and Keren. Likewise, the words pour and
poor are identical for many speakers.
```
```
In addition to the English vowels in Tables 2.2 and 2.3, there are also combinations
of vowels in English that function as a single unit in the sound system. These vowel
sequences are called diphthongs , in contrast to monophthongs , which are produced with
a single articulatory configuration. Diphthongs may be regarded as the vocalic equivalent

to affricates, since they involve two phases. There are three clear diphthongs in American
English. One is [aɪ], which starts off as [a] and then rapidly sequences into [ɪ]. The diph-
thong [aɪ] is found in many words in English including write, lie , and mine. The second
diphthong is [aʊ], which is found in words like cow, town , and bout. Finally, the diphthong
[ɔɪ] occurs in words like boy, soy , and toil. British English has a few additional diphthongs
corresponding to sequences of vowel plus [ɹ] for most speakers of American English. These
diphthongs, which all end in schwa, include [ɪə] in words like peer and fear , [eə] in words
like pear and care , and [ʊə] in words like poor and tour. Textbox 2.4 describes some of the
other diphthongs that occur in English, which are a little less clear.
```
### TEXTBOX 2.4 DIPHTHONGS IN BROAD AND NARROW PHONETIC

### TRANSCRIPTIONS

```
Students with a careful ear will notice that most
pronunciations of the English tense mid vowels [e] and
[o] are actually diphthongs, with the tongue moving
from the position of [e] to the position of [ɪ] in a word
like lay or either [o] to [ʊ] (American English) or [ə]
```
```
to [ʊ] (British English) in a word like show. A broad
phonetic transcription would transcribe these words
as [le] and [∫o]. A narrower phonetic transcription ,
one which seeks to record as much detail as possible,
would transcribe them as [leɪ] and either [∫oʊ] or [∫əʊ].
```
2.4 **Using the IPA to Transcribe Words**

```
Now that you are familiar with the IPA, we can try using it to transcribe English words.
One of the most important aspects of doing phonetic transcription is not to be
biased by the spelling of a word. Since spelling symbols often differ from IPA symbols,
as we have seen, blindly following the English orthography can lead to transcription
mistakes. In doing transcription, you may find it useful to first
think about how many sounds are in the word you are tran-
scribing. To take a simple example, the English word do has
two sounds. The first sound is a voiced alveolar stop [d], while
the second sound is a high back rounded vowel [u]. (Don’t be
influenced by the spelling of the vowel as “o.”) If we put the
two sounds together, we get [du] as the phonetic transcription.
Let’s take a slightly trickier example now. In the spelling of the
word checks , there are six letters. In terms of phonetic tran-
scription, however, there are only four sounds. The first sound
is the voiceless postalveolar affricate [t∫]. The vowel is the lax
mid-front vowel [ɛ]. The final consonant sequence consists of
a voiceless velar stop [k] and a voiceless alveolar fricative [s].
(Note that these are only two sounds [k] and [s], even though
there are three letters, “cks,” in the spelling.) With a little prac-
tice, you should be able to phonetically transcribe any English word, or even words in
other languages containing sounds that have been introduced in this chapter. It is also
possible to go in reverse and sound out the word from the phonetic transcription. For

2.5 Co-articulation
So far we have been considering sounds in isolation, but it is important to recognize that
there is overlap between sounds in actual speech. While one sound is being pronounced,
the speech organs are preparing to produce the next sound. This articulatory overlap
between sounds is termed co-articulation. It is easiest to observe co-articulation between
adjacent sounds that have different articulators. For example, during the production of a
bilabial consonant like [b], the tongue is free to move into position from the preceding
vowel into the following vowel, as in the word reboot , in which the tongue must move
backer to transition from the high front vowel /i/ to the high back vowel /u/. Consonants
other than bilabials may even be subject to co-articulation with adjacent vowels. For exam-
ple, the body of the tongue is relatively free to transition between vowels during alveolar
consonants, since alveolars primarily involve the tongue tip but do not involve posterior
parts of the tongue, which play a crucial role in producing vowels.
Figure 2.3 contains a sequence of MRI images showing co-articulation between adjacent
sounds in the word leap , extracted from the phrase pea leap. During the first three images,
the tongue tip is raised toward the alveolar ridge and the back of the upper teeth to produce
the lateral approximant /l/. Already by the fourth image, the middle part of the tongue
has begun to rise in preparation for the high vowel /i/ even as the tongue tip is still curled
upward for the /l/. (It may be noted that the tongue body is already in a relatively high
position for the high vowel preceding the /l/.) The tongue body continues to rise through
the fifth frame, reaching its target position by the sixth frame, as the tongue tip gesture for
/l/ completely ends. In the seventh frame, while the /i/ is still being articulated, the lips
are already starting to close in preparation for the final bilabial stop /p/. The lips make a
complete closure by the eighth frame, before gradually opening in the tenth and eleventh
frames.
```

**42 Matthew Gordon**

```
It is clear from Figure 2.3 that there is substantial co-articula-
tion between adjacent sounds. The tongue body is already pre-
paring for /i/ during the production of /l/, and the lips are already
moving into position for the /p/ during the /i/. Co-articulation is
an essential characteristic of all speech.
```
```
2.6 Phonetic Typology
Although English has a relatively large number of sounds,
it lacks many sounds that are found in other languages of
the world. Many of the gaps in the English IPA chart are filled
by symbols representing sounds which occur in other languages.
See Textbox 2.6 for an example of one such type of sound.

On the full IPA chart (see Sidebar 2.9), you will see a number of
new symbols that represent sounds not attested in English. For
example, the symbol [x] refers to a voiceless velar fricative, as
found in the final consonant in the German name Bach. There
are also places of articulation not found in English. For exam-
ple, many languages have uvular consonants, produced by the
back of the tongue coming into contact with or approximating
the uvula (the appendage which hangs down in the back of the
oral cavity). Uvular consonants are found in many languages,
such as French, which has a voiced uvular approximant as the
initial sound of rouge.
Another interesting category of sounds found in many lan-
guages of the world are the retroflex consonants , which
are often produced with the tip of the tongue curled backwards toward the roof of the
mouth behind the alveolar ridge. One language containing this type of retroflex consonant
is Tamil, a Dravidian language spoken primarily in southern India. In this language the
retroflex consonants are described as “subapical,” since the underside of the tongue makes
contact with the roof of the mouth. The MRI images in Figure 2.4 compare a retroflex lat-
eral approximant / ɭ/ with a dental / l̪/ (indicated by a subscripted ̪ to distinguish it from an
alveolar / l /), as produced by a Tamil speaker.
The place of articulation is much farther back in the mouth for the retroflex than for the
dental, and the tongue tip is clearly curled back during the retroflex so that the underside
of the tongue, rather than the upper surface, makes contact. For a description of some of
the methods linguists use to explore tongue position and other phonetic features of speech
sounds, see Textbox 2.5.

There are many other types of speech sounds in languages. While we cannot introduce
all of them here, there are now excellent resources for phonetics on the Internet. If you are

### TEXTBOX 2.5 INSTRUMENTAL PHONETIC TECHNIQUES

```
There are a number of instrumental techniques available
for learning about the phonetic properties of speech.
These include non-invasive procedures such as making
audio or video recordings to analyze acoustic features
and collecting airflow and air pressure data to study
aerodynamic properties. Other techniques for directly
analyzing articulatory gestures can be more complex
(and invasive) and include magnetic resonance imaging
```
```
(shown in Figures 2.3 and 2.4), electromagnetic
articulography, electroglottography (for studying the
larynx), and ultrasound, which is used to track tongue
position and is illustrated in the photograph below.
The book by Bryan Gick et al., cited in the Suggestions
for Further Reading at the end of the chapter, provides
an overview of a number of techniques used to gain
insight into articulatory properties of speech.
```
```

tracing his tongue position.
```

**45 2 Phonetics**

```
One relatively low-tech method for examining
articulation is static palatography. Palatography data are
collected by painting the tongue with a viscous mixture
of activated charcoal and olive oil and then producing
a sound, typically a consonant articulated somewhere
between the teeth and the soft palate. (Alternatively,
cocoa may be used instead of activated charcoal.) The
contact between the tongue and the roof of the mouth
leaves a residue of the olive oil and charcoal mixture
on the upper surface of the mouth at the point of
contact. This contact pattern, or palatogram, can be
examined and photographed for comparison with other
palatograms, by holding a mirror under the roof of the
```
```
mouth. The picture below contains two palatograms
illustrating a contrast between a dental stop (on the
left) and a postalveolar stop (on the right) in Ndumbea,
a language of New Caledonia whose phonetic system
is described in an article by Matthew Gordon and
Ian Maddieson (1999: 66–90). The palatograms are
photographs of the roof of the mouth made after the
consonant has been articulated. In the palatogram on the
left, there is black residue from the olive oil–charcoal mix
on the upper teeth, indicating that the consonant was a
dental. In the palatogram on the right, on the other hand,
the teeth are clean, indicating that the point of contact
was farther back in the mouth, in the postalveolar region.

### TEXTBOX 2.6 EJECTIVE STOPS

```
Ejective stops are common in indigenous languages
of North America. For example, Navajo, an Athabaskan
language spoken in the southwestern United States, has
ejective stops at several places of articulation.
To produce the ejective [k’], emphatically say the
English word cake without releasing the final velar stop.
While you are holding the stop closure, close your
glottis just as if you were making a glottal stop. Now
release the velar closure before releasing the glottal
```
```
stop and you should hear a popping sound much like
in the Navajo velar ejective. Sometimes it takes practice
to learn new sounds, so don’t be discouraged if you
don’t produce an ejective on your first try. Everyone
finds certain sounds easier to make than others.
Ejectives may come naturally to one person, while clicks
may come more naturally to someone else.

2.7 **Suprasegmentals**

```
In addition to describing individual speech sounds, phonetics is also con-
cerned with patterns over groups of sounds. Phonetic properties above
the level of individual sounds (otherwise known as segments ) fall under
the heading of suprasegmentals.
```
```
2.7.1 Syllables
One unit larger than the segment is the syllable. The syllable is a
linguistic grouping that consists of a single peak, which may be
flanked on one or both sides by consonants. The syllable peak (or
nucleus ) is so called because it is the most prominent (or loudest) part
of the syllable. The syllable peak typically comprises a vowel, the most prominent type
of sound. Consonants that precede the syllable peak within the syllable are referred to as
the syllable onset , while consonants that follow the peak are called the syllable coda.
Since consonants are less prominent than vowels, syllables typically first increase in promi-
nence (from the onset to the peak), then decrease (from the peak to the coda). Textbox 2.7
describes the less frequent occurrence of consonants as syllable peaks.
The IPA has a symbol for representing syllable boundaries. It is a period that is positioned
between syllables. For example, the name Mississippi has four syllables and would be tran-
scribed as [mɪ.sə.sɪ.pi].
```
### TEXTBOX 2.7 SYLLABIC CONSONANTS

```
Although most syllables have vowels as the peak of the
syllable, it is also possible to have consonantal peaks.
For example, the words little and button each have two
syllables, the second of which usually does not have
a true vowel. The syllable peak in the second syllable
of little is [l] while the peak in the second syllable of
button is [n]. Both of these sounds are sonorants, the
most prominent type of consonant, so they are natural
syllable peaks. The nasal [m] can also function as a
syllable peak in English as in prism. In most varieties
of American English, [ɹ] also occurs as a syllable peak
```
```
as in learn and the second syllable of butter. In British
English, the vowel [ɜ] rather than [ɹ] is the syllable
peak in words like learn and butter , though it is often
possible to hear a rhotic coloring to the vowel.
Consonants that function as syllable peaks are known
as syllabic consonants. In phonetic transcriptions,
they are indicated by the symbol [ ࡦ] appearing under
a consonant letter, e.g. [ɹ̩], [lࡦ], [nࡦ]. You may also
encounter [ɚ] (or [ɝ]), the symbol for a rhotacized
central vowel, instead of [ɹ̩] in varieties of English, e.g.,
American English, that have syllabic [ɹ̩].
```
2.7.2 Stress

```
Another important suprasegmental property is stress. Stress is the relative prominence of differ-
ent syllables in a word. Stressed syllables typically have some combination of longer duration,
greater loudness or higher pitch relative to unstressed syllables. In languages that have stress,
there is one syllable per word that carries the main or primary stress. For example, the first
syllable in sofa carries stress, while the second syllable in relax is stressed. The IPA symbol for
primary stress is [ˈ], which goes above and to the left of the first sound in the primary stressed
syllable. The transcriptions of sofa and relax would thus be [ޖsofԥ] and [riޖlæks], respectively.
```
### SIDEBAR 2.10

```
See the Nuuchahnulth
Language Profile (LP5)
for an example of a
language with ejectives
and glottalized sonorants.
See also the Tsez Language
Profile (LP7) for another
description of ejective stops.
```

**47 2 Phonetics**

```
It is also possible for a word, particularly a long word, to have secondary stresses that
are not as strong as the primary stress but are stronger than completely unstressed syllables.
The IPA symbol for secondary stress is [ˌ], which goes below and to the left of the secondary
stressed syllable. To take an example of secondary stress from English, the word Mississippi
has a secondary stress on the first syllable in addition to the primary stress on the third
syllable, thus [ˌmɪ.sə.ˈsɪ. pi].
English uses stress to differentiate some pairs of words with different meanings. For exam-
ple, the word insight is stressed on the first syllable, while the word incite is stressed on the
second syllable. English has several noun and verb pairs that differ in the location of stress.
For example, the noun convert has initial stress, while the verb
convert has stress on the second syllable. Similarly, the noun import
has stress on the first syllable, while the verb import has stress on
the second syllable. We can see that in English the position of
the primary stress cannot be predicted (for more on stress cross-
linguistically, see Textbox 2.8).
```

in another language, see the
Kabardian Language Profile (LP1).
```
```
2.7.3 Tone
In some languages, stress plays much less of a role than in English. This includes tone lan-
guages (see Textbox 2.9 for a discussion of the distribution of tone languages worldwide).
In tone languages, fundamental frequency (or its perceptual correlate, pitch) plays
an important part in distinguishing between words with different meanings. For
example, in Dida, a Kru language spoken in the Ivory Coast, Africa, the same string of
segments can have different meanings depending on the tone pattern associated with the
```
### TEXTBOX 2.8 STRESS SYSTEMS AROUND THE WORLD

```
Stress patterns display considerable diversity
cross-linguistically.
One of the major distinctions between stress systems
is whether stress falls a consistent distance from the
word edge across words of different shapes. In many
languages, the primary stress of a word falls on a
predictable syllable. For example, in Latvian, the first
syllable of a word receives primary stress, whereas in
Polish, primary stress falls on the second-to-last syllable,
also called the “penultimate” syllable, of the word.
This type of stress pattern, where the location of stress
can be predicted by its position in the word, is called
weight-insensitive stress. The three most common
locations of stress in weight-insensitive stress systems
are the initial syllable, the penultimate syllable, and
the final syllable, although other stress sites such as
the peninitial (second syllable from the left) and the
```
```
antepenultimate (third syllable from the right) are
also attested. Other languages, such as Yup’ik, display
weight-sensitive stress because they preferentially
stress intrinsically more prominent (termed “heavy”)
syllable types, e.g., syllables with long vowels or closed
syllables.
Another way in which stress systems differ cross-
linguistically is in whether they have only a single
primary stress per word or whether they place rhythmic
secondary stresses in longer words, as in the Florida
place name Apalachicola , phonetically [ˌæ.pə.ˌlæ.
tʃə.ˈkʰo.lə]. To learn more about the distribution
of stress systems cross-linguistically, the interested
reader is encouraged to refer to the four chapters and
accompanying maps (features 14–17) dealing with
stress in The World Atlas of Language Structures (http://
wals.info/feature).
```

```
string. To take one minimal pair, the word [su] with a mid tone means ‘tree,’ while the same
sound sequence with a low tone means ‘hot.’ (Dida also has other tones besides mid and
low tone.) English does not use tone to contrast words. Rather, in English fundamental fre-
quency plays an important role in signaling stress and also in the last of the suprasegmental
properties to be discussed here, intonation.
```
### TEXTBOX 2.9 TONE LANGUAGES AROUND THE WORLD

```
In some regions of the world the great majority of
languages have tone. This is particularly true of China,
Southeast Asia, and sub-Saharan Africa. (A discussion of
why linguistic features like tone cluster geographically
can be found in Section 13.6.) However, tone is not
restricted to these regions and, in fact, tone languages
are found in many parts of the world. To see the
distribution of tone languages, visit the excellent online
resource, The World Atlas of Language Structures , go to
the page on tone (http://wals.info/feature/13A), and
click on the “show map” button.
```
```
Tone languages include Mandarin, Cantonese,
and virtually every other Chinese language; Thai,
Vietnamese, Cambodian, and Tibetan in Southeast
Asia and the Tibetan Plateau; Zulu, Shona, Igbo,
Hausa, and Somali in Africa; Hopi and Cherokee in the
United States; Mixtec, Huave, and Otomí in Mexico;
and Kubeo and Pirahã in South America. Although
quite rare in Europe, simple tone systems are found
in Norwegian and Latvian. Two tone languages,
Manange and Seneca, are described in Language
Profiles 3 and 13.
```
2.7.4 Intonation

```
Intonation refers to the changes in fundamental frequency (pitch) that occur during a phrase
or an utterance. All languages (even tone languages) use differences in intonation pat-
terns to mark differences in meaning that are not conveyed by segmental differences.
For example, English statements are typically marked by a pitch fall at the end, while English
yes/no questions often have a pitch rise. The English sentence So, you don’t think that’ll work
can be uttered with either a rising or a falling pitch pattern, with very different connotations
(see Stop and Reflect 2.5). The pitch fall indicates that the speaker is summarizing the opinion
of the person he or she is talking to, whereas the pitch rise would be used to question whether
the person thinks something will work or not. Intonation patterns and their functions are
language-specific, with interesting variations across languages, as illustrated by Chickasaw in
Textbox 2.10.
```
### STOP AND REFLECT 2.5 INTONATION PATTERNS

```
Relatively small differences in intonation patterns can dramatically change the connotation of an utterance.
Try figuring out the meaning when the sentence So, you don’t think that’ll work is produced with three
different intonation patterns. Several alternative pronunciations can be found in sound files on the website.
What others can you produce and what meanings do these variations convey?

**49 2 Phonetics**

```
Intonation is a very complex area of phonetics since it is used for many functions. These
functions may include, among others, to signal that someone has finished speaking or is
going to continue speaking after a brief pause, to convey emotions, or to mark emphasis.
Intonation is further discussed in Chapter 10, on prosody.
```
### TEXTBOX 2.10 INTONATION IN STATEMENTS AND QUESTIONS

```
Most languages of the world have falling pitch as the
unmarked intonation contour at the end of declarative
sentences. Languages display more variation in whether
they employ rising or falling intonation at the end
of questions, with the possibility that different types
of questions, for example, questions requiring a yes
or no answer as opposed to those requiring specific
```
```
information (such as when something happened), can
differ in their intonation within the same language.
Chickasaw, a highly endangered American Indian
language of Oklahoma, is typologically unusual in that
many speakers employ a rise at the end of statements
and a fall at the end of questions.

```
### CHAPTER SUMMARY

```
In this chapter, we have discussed articulatory phonetics, which deals with how the
vocal organs produce speech. The speech organs can be divided into three regions. The
subglottal system, which comprises the lungs and the trachea, provides the air that the
upstream articulators manipulate to produce sound. The larynx is the gateway to the
supralaryngeal system; vibrations of the vocal folds in the larynx produce voicing, which
is a key component of many speech sounds. The supralaryngeal system includes the lips,
teeth, velum, and tongue, all of which can be moved to produce different speech sounds.
These sounds can all be classified according to manner and place of articulation, voicing,
and whether they are nasal or oral. We have also learned about the ways in which speech
sounds can be transcribed using the IPA. In addition to describing individual sounds,
phonetics includes the study of suprasegmental properties such as syllable structure, stress,
tone, and intonation. Taken together, the key features of speech production introduced in
this chapter on phonetics can be used to describe the sounds of a language; examining the
patterns of behavior for sounds within a language falls within the area of phonology, the
topic of the next chapter.

In _pan_ the word begins with the lips closed and vocal cords still. After the lips are released, the vocal cords
    begin to vibrate while the tongue is in a low position in the front of the oral cavity. The velum is lowered
    so air passes through the nasal cavity. The tongue raises and makes contact with the alveolar ridge, closing
    off the oral cavity entirely, but air continues to pass through the nose. In _pat_ , the articulation differs in that
    the velum remains raised, so the air is only expelled through the oral cavity. When the tongue contacts the
    alveolar ridge, the air is fully stopped.

**8.** The International Phonetic Alphabet was developed in the late nineteenth century by language teachers in
    France interested in creating a transcription system for teaching the pronunciation of foreign languages.
    Since its origination, the phonetic alphabet has been dramatically expanded to include sounds found in
    languages throughout the world, with the goal of representing all the sounds that are used to differentiate
    words in all languages. In addition, the group responsible for developing the IPA, the International
    Phonetic Association, has grown substantially and now has thousands of members throughout the world.
    Besides developing and maintaining the phonetic alphabet, the International Phonetic Association also
    produces a journal containing research articles on phonetics and phonetic descriptions of languages. The
    _Journal of the International Phonetic Association_ (or JIPA) was originally published exclusively using the IPA,
    although it now publishes articles primarily in English. Below are two versions, one in American English
    and one in British English, of a brief passage (in the IPA) from a fable that has been translated into many
    different foreign languages in JIPA. Read it aloud and write the passage in standard English orthography.

**9.** This exercise asks you to phonetically transcribe a short stretch of natural connected speech. For American
    English, the _How Languages Work_ website includes a video clip of Daniel Hieber, a UC Santa Barbara
    doctoral student in linguistics, presenting a prize-winning three-minute talk on revitalizing the Chitimacha
    language. For British English, a set of BBC radio programs on language matters in different locations around
    the world produced by British anthropologist Dr. Mark Turin, can be found at [http://markturin.arts.ubc.ca/](http://markturin.arts.ubc.ca/)

    Internet with a simple URL and not in a site that is password-protected or requires an account; and (2) of
    good quality with clearly audible speech (excluding singing) by a single person. Choose a short segment of
    the recording consisting of at least 25 spoken words.
    **a.** Provide the URL where you found your clip and any additional details needed to direct your instructor
       to the specific clip that you used.
    **b.** Note the start and end times of your clip in minutes and seconds.
    **c.** Transcribe that stretch of speech in normal English spelling.
    **d.** Transcribe the words using the IPA. If there is more than one intonation unit, you may place them on
       separate lines.
    **e.** Make a list of the first sound from each word and describe those sounds in articulatory terms: place,
       manner, and voicing (for consonants) or height/backness/rounding/tenseness (for vowels).

etc.
```
**10.** Find a speaker of a language which you have never spoken or studied and ask if they would be willing
    to pronounce some words for you. Transcribe the words for the parts of the hand: _hand, palm, finger,_
    _fingernail, knuckle, wrist_ , and any other vocabulary the language might have. (It can be particularly
    interesting to ask for the words for each finger – pinky finger, ring finger, etc. – as these are often
    compounds with interesting meanings.) Do your best to transcribe each word in IPA. Be sure to mark any
    stress, tone, length, and/or nasalization that you hear.
       If you come across a sound you haven’t heard before, try to produce it yourself, using the speaker’s
    feedback to improve your pronunciation. Then pay close attention to the positioning of your articulators
    and describe the sound using the descriptors for place of articulation, manner of articulation, voicing,
    vowel height, vowel backness, rounding, and tenseness. You can use the IPA chart in this book and
    the interactive IPA chart online as an additional resource. Your report on this study should include the
    following:
    **a.** Name of the language
    **b.** Name of your speaker
    **c.** One paragraph biography of the speaker (where they grew up, schooling, what other languages they
       learned, when)
    **d.** At least ten words transcribed in IPA, with the English translations in single quotation marks
    **e.** Phonetic descriptions of any sounds that are not also found in English, together with their associated
       IPA symbols.

_Note_ : This is a challenging exercise for someone who is just beginning to study linguistics. The goal is to
expose you to other languages, to give you the experience of working with a speaker of a language that
is unknown to you, to teach you to listen carefully, and to begin to train you to hear and produce sounds
in other languages. We don’t expect perfect accuracy, but do your best! If you go on to study more
linguistics, you may have an opportunity to do a fuller study of this type in a course on phonetics.

Phonology is the study of how sounds systematically behave. We will see in this chapter that
sounds often pattern together in groups with respect to where they occur and how they interact
with other groups of sounds. We will learn how to analyze the phonological systems of languages
by examining the distribution of sounds in words. We will see that sounds have different statuses
in language: some sounds (called phonemes ) differentiate meanings while other sounds (called
allophones ) do not. These and other complex sound patterns can be represented by formal
phonological rules. We will also explore some of the competing phonetic motivations driving
phonological patterns. This will allow us to understand the ways in which phonological rules are
grounded in both the phonetic and the functional bases of human language.

3.1 **Natural Classes**

```
The notion of groups or classes of sounds was introduced earlier in Chapter 2. For conso-
nants, we saw that phonetic features describing voicing and place or manner of articulation
can be used to divide sounds into groups. For example, the alveolars of English are [t, d, n,
s, z, ɹ, l], while the nasals of English are [m, n, ŋ]. For vowels, phonetic terms for height,
backness, tenseness, and rounding can be used to divide vowel sounds into classes. Thus, [i,
ɪ, e, ɛ, æ] are front vowels and [i, e, u, o] are tense vowels.
These same phonetic features can be used to describe groups of sounds that
behave together in a phonological system. Groups of sounds
that pattern together are called natural classes. Recall the dis-
cussion of the forms of the English past tense from Chapter 1.
We saw that the past tense of regular verbs in English is formed
through addition of the suffix spelled - ed in the orthography.
Phonetically, the - ed suffix has three realizations. One realization
is as a voiceless alveolar stop [t] in such words as walked [wakt],
trapped [tɹæpt], washed [waݕt], laughed [læft], and poached [potݕt].
Another realization is as a voiced alveolar stop in words such
as rubbed [݋ʌbd], wagged [wægd], buzzed [bʌzd], judged [dݤʌdݤd],
rhymed [݋aܼmd], and planned [plænd]. The third realization is to
pronounce - ed as [ԥd] in words like seated [sitəd/siɾəd] (depend-
ing on your dialect), baited [betԥd/beɾəd], padded [pædəd/pæݐəd], needed [nidəd/niɾəd],
rented [ɹɛntԥd], and landed [lændəd].
The choice of how to pronounce the past-tense suffix when associated with a particular
word is not an arbitrary or unpredictable one that requires rote memorization of the past
tense for every English word. Rather, there is a pattern that governs the selection of the
realization. The [t] realization is used when the base verb form (or root) ends in a voiceless
consonant, the [d] realization with verb roots ending in a voiced consonant, and the [əd]
variant with verb roots ending in an alveolar stop (or, in American English, a flap).
The relationship between the root-final consonant and the selection of a past-tense
variant is sensible from a phonetic standpoint. The realization [t] is voiceless, as are the
consonants that trigger the [t] past tense; the realization [d] is voiced, as are the conso-
nants that trigger the [d] past tense. The general pattern is thus one of voicing agreement
between the root-final consonant and the past-tense suffix. Voicing harmony is one type
of assimilation process, whereby two sounds come to share some property or cluster
of properties. Assimilation is the most common type of phonological process and
comes in many guises , for example, place-of-articulation assimilation, manner assimi-
lation, nasal assimilation, and rounding assimilation. Like other assimilation phenom-
ena, voicing assimilation is phonetically motivated. It is articulatorily easier to maintain
the same laryngeal setting (either voiced or voiceless) throughout the entire cluster that
```
### SIDEBAR 3.1

terms and bolded terms throughout
this chapter in the Glossary (at the
back of this book or on the student

quizzes, a guide and flowchart on
phonemic analysis, a rule-writing

**57 3 Phonology**

```
consists of the root-final consonant and the past-tense suffix than it is to rapidly change
from voiced to voiceless or vice versa.
The final realization [əd] also has phonetic grounding. It would be difficult to produce the
past-tense alveolar stop immediately after another alveolar stop or flap without an inter-
vening vowel. The schwa [ə] is the perfect “filler vowel” for such cases, because it requires
relatively little phonetic effort since it is produced with the tongue near its resting position.
The variation in the realization of the past-tense suffix illustrates one of the fundamental
principles guiding many phonological alternations: the drive toward minimizing articu-
latory effort. Both voicing assimilation and schwa insertion reduce the amount of articu-
latory exertion required to produce the past-tense form of English verbs. As your study of
phonology progresses, the attempt to minimize articulatory effort will emerge as a recurring
theme in the organization of phonological systems. The goal of the phonologist is not
merely to describe the patterns found in languages but also to explain the forces motivating
these patterns, which are often (though not always) phonetically driven.
Given the importance of phonetic considerations in shaping phonological systems, it is
not surprising that natural classes play a crucial role in the study of phonology. Consequently,
recognizing natural classes is an important analytical skill to develop. In order for a set of
sounds to form a natural class, two criteria must be met: first, the sounds must all
share one or more phonetic features; second, the sounds must be the complete set
of sounds sharing those features in the given data. To demonstrate the application of
these two criteria, consider the IPA chart for English consonants in Table 3.1.
Keeping in mind the two criteria for a natural class, consider the following sets of conso-
nants and determine whether or not they constitute natural classes.

```
The first group of sounds satisfies the first condition for being a natural class, since all
of the sounds are voiceless stops. They also meet the second criterion, since the data set
comprises the entire set of voiceless stops in the English IPA chart. Set (1) is thus a natural
class. Notice that we need the two phonetic features “voiceless” and “stop” to correctly
define this natural class. If we said only that the natural class is the set of voiceless sounds,
this would not be adequate since there are many voiceless sounds in the data set that are
not in Set (1), e.g., the voiceless fricatives. Nor could we simply describe the natural class as
“stops,” since Set (1) is missing all of the voiced stops, both oral and nasal.
The second group of sounds also satisfies the first condition since all of the sounds are
nasals. Set (2) also meets the second condition, since the sounds constitute the entire group
of nasals in the data set.
The third group is a little trickier. It is true that the sounds in Set (3) satisfy the first
condition for being a natural class, since they are all alveolars. However, Set (3) is not an
exhaustive set of the alveolars in the data: it is missing [z]. For this reason, the third group
is not a natural class.
The fourth group is a small set of sounds, which have in common that they are voiced
bilabial stops. Set (4) is also the complete set of voiced bilabial stops in English, so we have
a natural class. Notice that we need all three descriptive features, “voiced,” “bilabial,” and
“stop,” to describe this natural class. The omission of any of these descriptors would mean
that the second criterion for being a natural class, that the sounds be an exhaustive set for
the given data, would not be met.
```
### STOP AND REFLECT 3.1 NATURAL CLASSES IN ENGLISH

```
Use the two criteria of sharing one or more phonetic features and of comprising all of the sounds with those
features in the language to determine whether the following groups of consonants constitute natural classes
in English. You can check your answers in Sidebar 3.2 on the next page.
a. ɹ, l
b. g, ŋ, w
c. p, b, t, d, k, g
d. v, ð, ʒ
e. ʃ, ʒ, tʃ, dʒ
```
```
The requirement that a natural class be the exhaustive set of sounds sharing the specified
features for a given data set means that the same set of sounds can be a natural class
in one language but not in another language. Consider the inventory of consonants in
Chickasaw, an American Indian language spoken in Oklahoma (Table 3.2).
Most of the consonants in Chickasaw also occur in English, with the exception of the
voiceless lateral fricative [ɬ]. This sound is similar to the lateral approximant [l], except that
[ɬ] is voiceless and is produced with turbulence at the constriction point. It has a sound
much like that of English [l] when it occurs immediately after a voiceless stop, such as in
the word play.
```

**59 3 Phonology**

```
Consider the following set of sounds: [p, b, t, k, ݦ]. In English, this set of sounds would
not be a natural class; it is missing [d] and [g], which would be necessary to form the com-
plete set of oral stops in English. However, this same set of sounds is a natural class for
Chickasaw, since it is the exhaustive set of Chickasaw oral stops.
Now let us consider the set of sounds [t, s]. These sounds have in common that they are
voiceless. This is insufficient for describing a natural class in either English or Chickasaw,
however, since there are other voiceless sounds in both languages. If we add the feature
“alveolar,” we fare better in English at least, since [t, s] is the exhaustive set of English
voiceless alveolars. However, [t, s] still does not constitute a natural class in Chickasaw,
since Chickasaw has a third voiceless alveolar that English does not, namely the voiceless
alveolar lateral fricative [ɬ]. For this reason, [t, s] is a natural class in English but not in
Chickasaw.
```
```
3.2 Phonemic Analysis
3.2.1 Phonemes and Minimal Pairs
Different kinds of phonological relationships can hold between sounds in a lan-
guage. First, some sounds can be used to distinguish words with different meanings. For
example, the voiceless bilabial stop [p] and the voiceless alveolar stop [t] in English can be
used to differentiate words. There are thus many pairs of words such as pan vs. tan, pill vs. till,
spill vs. still, pop vs. pot , and lip vs. lit , which are differentiated only by whether they have [p]
or [t] in a particular position. The occurrence of these sounds is unpredictable and simply an
arbitrary property of individual words. In other words, speakers must memorize each word as
having either [p] or [t] in the proper place. This is different from the situation with the English
past-tense suffixes, where one could predict the past-tense realization based on the root-final

the correct variant of the past-tense suffix.
```
### STOP AND REFLECT 3.2 PHONEMES ARE UNPREDICTABLE

```
In English, [p] and [t] distinguish words with different meanings. Thus, we cannot predict which sound will
occur in a particular environment. For example, consider the environment [__ost] (written in IPA). Will this
word begin with [p] or [t]?
Both sounds work equally well in this environment. Using [t] will give us toast , while [p] will give us post.
Thus, the occurrence of [p] and [t] is unpredictable in English.
```
```
Pairs of words like pan vs. tan, pill vs. till, spill vs.
still, pop vs. pot , and lip vs. lit are called minimal pairs.
Minimal pairs consist of two words which have
different meanings and differ in only one sound
occurring in the same environment. In this case, the
minimal pairs differ only in the presence of [p] or [t] in
a certain position in the word. In the first two pairs, pan
vs. tan and pill vs. till , [p] and [t] occur word-initially. In
spill vs. still , [p] and [t] occur between [s] and [ɪ]. In the
last two pairs, pop vs. pot and lip vs. lit , [p] and [t] occur
word-finally.
Minimal pairs can be found for many different pairs of sounds in English. For example,
the minimal pair rain vs. raid differs only in the final consonant, [n] vs. [d]; the minimal
pair boot vs. suit differs only in the initial consonant, [b] vs. [s]; the minimal pair seat vs. sit
is differentiated only by the vowel, [i] vs. [ɪ]; and the minimal pair made vs. mood is distin-
guished only by the vowel, [e] vs. [u].
It is also possible to find minimal triplets, in which three words are distinguished by a
single sound, e.g., made [e] vs. mood [u] vs. mode [o]. In English, one can even find quadru-
plets (e.g., seat vs. sit vs. sat vs. suit ) as well as sets consisting of even more members that
are distinguished by single sounds. All of these minimal sets are useful for illustrating
that certain sounds in a language are used to differentiate words.
The requirement that minimal pairs have a single sound difference in the same environ-
ment excludes certain pairs of words from constituting minimal pairs. For example, the pair
of words mat [mæt] and mole [mol] are not a minimal pair. Even though these words have
different meanings and even though the first consonant is the same in both words, they
differ with respect to two sounds: the vowel and the final consonant. The pair of words slot
[slat] and late [let] is also not a minimal pair, since there are two sound differences between
the words. The first word has an [s] not present at the beginning of the second word, and the
vowels in the two words also differ. Finally, even though there is only one sound difference
between the two words pat and nap , they are not a minimal pair since the sounds that differ
occur in different environments.

The concept of minimal pairs is important in phonology, since minimal pairs demon-
strate the contrastive nature of sounds. Thus, [p] and [t] are contrastive, as they contrast
words with different meanings. The sounds [n] and [d], [e] and [u], and so on, are also
contrastive. Sounds that are used to contrast words with different meanings have a
special status in phonology: they are called phonemes. Phonemes form the building
blocks of minimal pairs (or minimal sets of words). For this reason, changing the phonemes
in a word often produces completely different words. For example, if you replace the [p]
in the beginning of pile with a [t], the result is a different word, tile. Phonemes are thus an
arbitrary property of individual words: in order to know a word, you must know which
phonemes occur in it and how they are ordered.
Given the relationship between minimal pairs and phonemes, we can use minimal pairs
to diagnose whether or not sounds are phonemes in a language. If two sounds in ques-
tion are phonemes, we expect to find minimal pairs differentiated only by the two target
sounds. In reality, though, sometimes it is not possible to find perfect minimal pairs dif-
ferentiated by only a single sound for every phoneme. Sometimes it is necessary to settle
for near-minimal pairs. To illustrate the usefulness of near-minimal pairs, consider the
pair of sounds [ð] and [ݤ] in English. It is difficult to find minimal pairs to demonstrate the
phonemic status of these two sounds in English. One possible minimal pair is bathe vs. beige
in which the relevant contrast occurs in final position.
However, some speakers pronounce the second word with a voiced postalveolar affricate
[dݤ] rather than the fricative [ݤ]. For these speakers, there are probably no true minimal
pairs for [ð] and [ݤ]. Does this mean that these two sounds are not separate phonemes in
English? No, because it is possible to find a near-minimal pair for the two sounds: leather
vs. pleasure. Clearly, this is not a minimal pair as there is more than one difference between
the two words. Not only do the words differ in whether they have a [ð] or a [ݤ], but pleasure
also has an extra sound at the beginning of the word that leather does not. Still, pleasure and
leather qualify as a near-minimal pair, since the sounds immediately adjacent to the target
sounds, [ð] and [ݤ], are the same in both words: [ɛ] before the target sound and [ɹ] (American
```

**62 Matthew Gordon**

```
English) or [ɜ] (British English) after it. Like minimal pairs, near-minimal pairs are usually
sufficient to demonstrate that two sounds are separate phonemes in a language.
```
3.2.2 Allophones and Complementary Distribution

```
Phonemes have different phonetic realizations depending on where they occur. For
example, [p] is not pronounced identically in the words pin and spin. If you hold your hand
in front of your mouth while saying the two words, you will notice that the [p] in pin has
a very clear puff of air upon release, while the [p] in spin largely
lacks this salient puff of air. The puff of air associated with the
[p] in pin is called aspiration. The [p] in pin is thus an aspirated
stop, represented as [pހ] in the IPA. A [p] occurring immediately
after an [s], as in spin , on the other hand, is an unaspirated stop
and is simply represented as [p].
Aspiration, in fact, is a regular feature of voiceless stops in
English when they occur in word-initial position. As with the
bilabial stop in spin , the alveolar and velar stops [t] and [k] also
have variants differing in aspiration depending on context.
Thus, we have aspirated stops word-initially in take and come but
unaspirated stops after [s] in stake and scum.
Crucially, the [p] in both pin and spin is associated with the
same phoneme in English, since there are no minimal pairs dif-
ferentiated solely on the basis of whether they have unaspirated
[p] or aspirated [pހ] in the same position. Rather, the two kinds of
[p] are variants of each other that are predictable from the con-
text. When [p] occurs word-initially, it will always be aspirated;
when [p] occurs after [s] it will always be unaspirated. Therefore,
there is no need to memorize whether a given word has an aspi-
rated or an unaspirated [p], since aspiration is predictable from
the context. The relationship between aspirated and unaspirated
[p] in English is an allophonic one, in which aspirated [pހ] and
unaspirated [p] are allophones of the same phoneme. Two
sounds are allophones if they occur in mutually exclusive environments, i.e., if one
allophone occurs in one set of contexts and another allophone occurs in another
set of contexts. Stop and Reflect 3.4 illustrates this by demonstrating that the occurrence
of allophonic variants is predictable. There is no single environment in which both allo-
phones can occur. This basic criterion for allophones is called complementary distribution.
So far we have seen that pairs of sounds may occur in two types of distribution. One
possibility is for two sounds to have a contrastive distribution , meaning that they can
occur in the same environment, in words with different meanings. This describes the type
of distribution found in minimal pairs, which proves that two sounds are separate pho-
nemes. The second type of distribution is complementary distribution , which arises
when two sounds occur in a different set of environments from each other. Complementary
distribution indicates that two sounds are allophones of the same phoneme.
```
### SIDEBAR 3.3

```
Answers to Stop and Reflect 3.3:
Of the nine pairs of words in Stop
and Reflect 3.3, six constitute
minimal pairs (Examples 1– 3 and
7 – 9 ), while three (Examples 4– 6 )
do not. If this was not your answer,
perhaps you were misled by English
orthography. Try transcribing each
word in the International Phonetic
Alphabet. You will see that word
pairs 1–3 and 7–9 are obviously
minimal pairs.
Word pairs 4–6 are not minimal
pairs, since they all differ in terms
of more than one sound. Grout and
clout differ in two sounds: both the
initial stop and the following liquid;
restrain has three consonants after
the first vowel while remain has
only one; and finger has a distinct
voiced velar stop [g] after the velar
nasal, while singer does not for most
speakers of English (a phonetic
distinction not represented in the
English spelling).

### STOP AND REFLECT 3.4 ALLOPHONES IN COMPLEMENTARY DISTRIBUTION

### ARE PREDICTABLE

```
Can you predict whether the voiceless stops in the following words will be aspirated or unaspirated?
```
**1.** _pore_
**2.** _tore_
**3.** _core_
**4.** _pool_
**5.** _tool_
**6.** _cool_
**7.** _spore_
**8.** _store_
**9.** _score_
**10.** _spool_
**11.** _stool_
**12.** _school_
    You can check your answer by pronouncing each word with your hand in front of your mouth. Notice that
words 1 – 6 all have the puff of air referred to as aspiration while words 7 – 12 do not.
    Now consider two nonsense words: _tobe_ and _stobe_. Can you predict which will have an initial aspirated
stop and which will have an unaspirated stop? Check your answer by pronouncing each of these two words.
If your prediction was that the stop in _tobe_ would have aspiration and _stobe_ would not, you were right. Any
word, even a nonsense word, will conform to the pattern we’ve established. This is why we say that the
presence of aspiration on voiceless stops in English is predictable.

```
In phonology, there are conventions for representing phonemes and allophones. It is
customary to represent separate phonemes between slashes // and allophones in brackets
[ ]. Brackets are also used in order to remain neutral about whether a sound is a phoneme
or merely an allophone; for example, if you are examining new data and haven’t yet deter-
mined the status of a sound, or if the status of a sound as a phoneme vs. an allophone is not
crucial to the point being made.
We may now summarize the relationship between the sounds [p], [pހ], [t], and [tހ]. (Notice
that I am using the brackets here for a moment in order not to anticipate the conclusion
about their phonemic statuses.) We have seen that [p] and [t] are in contrastive distribu-
tion, since they occur in the same position in minimal and near-minimal pairs. We have
also learned that aspirated stops are in complementary distribution with unaspirated stops,
since they occur in different environments and do not form the basis for minimal pairs. The
relationship between the four sounds can thus be represented as in Figure 3.1.
Figure 3.1 shows that the phoneme /p/ (written in slashes) has two allophones: an unaspi-
rated allophone occurring after [s] and an aspirated allophone occurring word-initially.
```
```

```
Phonemes /p/ /t/
```
```
Allophones [p][ph] [t] [th]
```

**64 Matthew Gordon**

```
Likewise, the phoneme /t/ has two allophones: an unaspirated allophone occurring after
[s] and an aspirated allophone occurring word-initially. Note that it is common for one of
the allophones of a phoneme to be identical to the phoneme itself, just as is the case with
each of the unaspirated allophones here. The phoneme that is associated with the allo-
phones is often termed the underlying phoneme , while the other allophones linked to
the phoneme are often called the surface allophones. The assumption here is that words
are memorized with the underlying phonemes, since this information is unpredictable and
must be learned for each word. The surface forms then arise through a process or series of
processes that give the underlying phonemes their actual phonetic realizations.
The phonemic status of the same sound (i.e., whether it is a separate phoneme or
an allophone) may differ from language to language. To demonstrate this, let us con-
sider some data from Hupa, an American Indian language spoken in northwest California
(Table 3.3). The sounds whose phonemic status are in question are the pair [t] and [tހ] and the
pair [ɪ] and [u]. Some of the special symbols used are explained in Textbox 3.1.
```
```

t[ʍ] indicates a voiceless labial-velar fricative, like the
wh that some English speakers pronounce in words
like why and which.
```
```
t[ʷ] in ‘he is crying’ indicates that the preceding
sound has lip rounding associated with it.
t[ː] after a vowel indicates that the vowel is
pronounced as lengthened.
t[ɬ] indicates a voiceless lateral fricative.
```

2.6. They are also found in the

```
```
First, looking at the pair [t] and [tހ], it is clear that they are
separate phonemes since your mouth and your father form a
perfect minimal pair for these two sounds. Furthermore, three
```

**65 3 Phonology**

```
and sweathouse both form a near-minimal pair with how , since three and sweathouse
both begin with an aspirated [th] before the vowel [a] and how begins with an unaspi-
rated [t] in the same environment. We thus conclude that unaspirated [t] and aspirated
[tހ] are separate phonemes in Hupa, whereas in English, they are allophones of the
same phoneme. This difference between the status of the sounds in English and in
Hupa is illustrated in Sidebar 3.5.
Turning to [ɪ] and [u], we know that these sounds are sepa-
rate phonemes in English on the basis of minimal pairs such
as sit vs. suit and tin vs. tune. In Hupa, however, we do not
find minimal pairs differentiated only by these two vowels.
Nor are there are any near-minimal pairs for [ɪ] and [u] in the
data above. This can be determined by creating a chart with
the environments in which each of the target sounds occur. In
making such a chart, it is important to include both the sound
immediately preceding the target sound and the sound imme-
diately following it. A chart for the target vowels [ɪ] and [u] in the Hupa data is given in
Table 3.4. The line between the preceding and following sounds is a placeholder for the
target sound.
If there were a minimal or near-minimal pair in the data, we would be able to find an
environment in Table 3.4 that was identical for the two target sounds; however, this is
not the case. Therefore, we do not have a contrastive distribution and the two sounds
are not separate phonemes; [ɪ] and [u] thus stand in a different relationship in Hupa
than in English. By process of elimination, this means that [ɪ] and [u] are allophones
of the same phoneme in Hupa. If this is in fact true, they should be in complementary
distribution, meaning that we should be able to find a different set of environments
for each of the two sounds. To do this, we must ask whether there is any environment
in which one sound occurs throughout the data, to the exclusion of the other sound.
```

Keep in mind that this environment can involve either the
preceding or the following sound, or both, and also that the
environment could be expressed in terms of a natural class.
In fact, in Table 3.4, we can see that the [u] always occurs
before a labial-velar sound, while the [ɪ] never occurs in this
environment. We thus conclude that [ɪ] and [u] are in comple-
mentary distribution. It is typically easier to characterize the
environment for one of the target sounds than for the other. In
this case, it is easier to describe the environment in which [u]
occurs, since the positions in which [ɪ] occurs are quite diverse. It is sufficient to give the
environment for [u] and to state that [ɪ] occurs “elsewhere,” meaning that it occurs in the
environments in which [u] does not occur.
As a final step in our analysis, we need to formulate a summary statement of the relation-
ship between the target sounds in the language. This statement might be as follows:
```
```
In Hupa, [ɪ] and [u] are allophones of the same phoneme. [u] occurs before labial-velars
and [ɪ] occurs elsewhere.
```
```
We might want to take the analysis one step further and decide which of the allophones
is the underlying phoneme and which are the surface allophones. It is common to
assume that the allophone that occurs in a more diverse set of environments (i.e., in the
“elsewhere” set of contexts) is the underlying phoneme, and to derive the other allo-
phone(s) by a rule. For the Hupa data, this would mean that /ɪ/ is the underlying pho-
neme and that [u] occurs before labial-velars. Our final analysis might thus be expanded
as follows:
```
```
In Hupa, [ɪ] and [u] are allophones of the same phoneme. /ɪ/ is the underlying phoneme.
/ɪ/ becomes [u] before labial-velars.
```
```
Once you have an analysis of phonemic data, it is also possible to make predictions about
further data that you might not yet have seen. For example, after it has been determined
that [ɪ] and [u] are allophones in Hupa and that [u] occurs before labial-velars, we can pre-
dict that any new Hupa data should conform to these generalizations. Thus, we should not
find any examples of an [ɪ] sound before a labial-velar consonant. In fact, there is an even
more interesting prediction that we can make for Hupa. You may recall that Hupa has a
labialized velar fricative [xއ], which occurred in the form [taxއeːt] ‘how.’ This sound is simi-
lar to the German sound at the end of the composer Bach’s name, but also has lip rounding.
Given that [xއ] is both labial and velar, we would expect it to trigger the [u] allophone. This
prediction can be easily tested. The name that the Hupa use for themselves is [naːtʰܼnuxއ],
which literally means ‘where the trail leads back.’ (The root for ‘trail’ [tʰܼn] appeared earlier
in Table 3.3.) As expected, there is an [u] before the final [xއ], providing further evidence
for our assimilation rule and our proposed phonetic explanation for it. This is one example
of a local phonological process; some non-local phonological processes are described in
Textbox 3.3.

```
3.2.3 Writing Phonological Rules
The statement about the change from underlying /ɪ/ to surface [u] in Hupa can be written
more formally as a rule using features, as in (1).
```
```
(1) /ɪ/ ĺ [u] / __ [+labial-velar]
```
```
Rule (1) is read as follows: /ɪ/ becomes [u] in the environment before sounds that are
labial-velar. It is common in phonology to formalize relationships between phonemes
and allophones using rules. The Hupa rule of vowel rounding targets a single sound,
the vowel /ɪ/. As we have seen, allophones often refer to sets of sounds that constitute
natural classes. The environment that triggers rounding in Hupa is the natural class of
labial-velar consonants. Natural classes of sounds targeted by a rule can also be expressed
in rules using features. For example, members of the set of voiceless stops in English are
realized with aspiration in word-initial position. Aspiration can be written using features
as in (2).
```
```
(2) [+stop, −voice] ĺ [+aspirated] / # __
```
```
Rule (2) targets English sounds characterized by the features [+stop] and [−voice], changing
them to their [+aspirated] counterparts in the environment after a word boundary, written
with a # sign. Another way to write this rule is to replace the feature [+stop] with the feature
[−continuant]. Sounds that are [−continuant] are produced with a complete closure in the
oral tract. Sounds fitting this description include both the oral and the nasal stops. If you
continue in phonology, you will learn more about the features used by phonologists to write
rules. In some instances, as is the case for stops, phonological features differ from phonetic
features. The reason for the occasional divergence between phonetic and phonological fea-
tures lies in the differing goals of phoneticians and phonologists. Phoneticians are primar-
ily interested in providing an accurate and maximally transparent description of sounds,
whereas phonologists are focused on describing the patterning of sounds in a language in as
succinct a manner as possible.
It is helpful to become accustomed to reading and writing phonological rules. Further
examples of rules are given in Textbox 3.2; there is also a guide to rule writing available on
the website.
```
```
3.2.4 Functional and Phonetic Reasons for Allophones
While our analysis of the Hupa vowels may be sufficient for most purposes, it is also worth-
while to take a step back to ponder why this alternation might be taking place. In this
case, the motivation is clearly phonetic in nature. Labial-velar sounds are produced with
lip rounding, just like the allophone [u]. It is natural for an unrounded vowel to assimilate
in rounding to an adjacent consonant with lip rounding. It is also natural for the vowel
adjacent to the labial-velar to be pronounced with a backer articulation, since a labial-velar
has a velar component. The conversion from /ɪ/ to [u] before labial-velars in Hupa is thus a
phonetically natural process of assimilaton.
```
```
Rule
writing
guide
```

**68 Matthew Gordon**

```
Many phonological phenomena such as assimilation seem to be driven by the
goal of reducing the amount of work required of the vocal organs. Effort reduction,
however, is not the only force behind phonology. Another important consideration is
perceptual salience ; phonological systems tend to be constructed in a way that
increases the perceptual distinctness of sounds from one another. Perceptual sali-
ence plays an important role in driving certain phonological processes, including dissim-
ilation , the process by which a sound changes to become less like a nearby sound. For
example, in Finnish, when two /ɑ/ (low back unrounded) vowels might otherwise occur in
adjacent syllables, the second dissimilates to /o/ when the plural suffix - i is added, as shown
in Table 3.5. The two vowels thus become different from each other; the second dissimilates
from the first.
Since we are thinking about phonetic motivations, let us ponder whether the aspira-
tion of word-initial stops in English is also phonetically natural. In fact, aspiration may be
viewed as a natural kind of strengthening process, called fortition. Word-initial position
is a common locus of fortition, which can take many forms, such as the change from a
fricative to a stop or the change from an approximant to a stop or fricative. This is prob-
ably because word-initial sounds play such an important role in word recognition. The
stronger and more perceptible the first sound of a word, the easier it will be for the listener
to correctly hear the word. Initial fortition thus seems to be driven by considerations of
perceptual salience.

### TEXTBOX 3.3 LOCAL AND LONG-DISTANCE ASSIMILATION

```
Most assimilation processes are like the English
past-tense voicing assimilation and the Hupa
rounding assimilation in that they are conditioned by
immediately surrounding sounds. Processes governed
by an adjacent environment are called local. While
most assimilation processes are local, there are some
that are non-local or long distance. One common type
of long-distance assimilation is vowel harmony , which
is found in many Ural-Altaic languages, such as Finnish,
Hungarian, and Turkish. The most common type of
vowel harmony involves assimilation in vowel backness.
In a language with prototypical front-back vowel
harmony, all vowels in a word must agree in backness.
This means that there are multiple forms of suffixes
containing a vowel that differ in vowel backness.
```
```
To take an example from Finnish, the inessive suffix,
which means ‘inside,’ has two allomorphs. The variant
containing a front vowel ( -s ː æ ) occurs after roots with
front vowels, e.g., kylæs ː æ ‘in the village,’ whereas
the allomorph containing a back vowel ( -s ːɑ) appears
after roots with back vowels, e.g., talos ːɑ ‘in the
house.’ Crucially, the consonants intervening between
vowels are typically ignored by vowel harmony. There
are other types of vowel harmony systems involving
other dimensions, including lip rounding (e.g., in
Turkish) and tongue root advancement (e.g., in
Akan and other West African languages). Consonant
harmony systems are also attested. Some types
of harmony affecting consonants include nasality,
voicing, and backness.
```
```
The opposite of fortition is lenition , which is a weakening
process by which consonants become less consonant-like and
more vowel-like. For example, some voiced stops in Spanish
weaken to sounds that are more fricative or approximant-like
after vowels. Thus, the first “d” in the Spanish word dedo ‘finger’
is a true voiced stop, but the second one is pronounced quite
similarly to the English voiced interdental fricative [ð]. In con-
trast to fortition, lenition is often driven by considerations of
articulatory ease. In the Spanish example, it is easier to produce
a fricative or approximant than a full stop when the sound is
surrounded by vowels.
The goals of reducing effort and of maximizing perceptual distinctness often conflict,
since it takes more effort to make sounds more distinct. To see this, compare the vowel
contrast between /i/ and /u/ with another contrast between /ə/ and /ʌ/. The first contrast is
perceptually more robust, since /i/ and /u/ sound very different from each other; one vowel
is high and front, while the other is high and back. This contrast, however, is relatively
difficult to execute articulatorily, since both /i/ and /u/ require tongue positions that are
far from the rest position of the tongue in the center of the mouth. The contrast between
/ə/ and /ʌ/, on the other hand, is relatively easy from an articulatory standpoint, since both
vowels are close to the tongue’s neutral rest position in the middle of the mouth. However,
this contrast is relatively subtle from a perceptual standpoint, as the two vowels are acousti-
cally quite similar. The perceptual proximity of /ə/ and /ʌ/ is, in fact, easy to verify if you ask
someone else to produce the two in isolation and try to guess which one is which.
The phonological systems of languages are the result of compromise between the
two goals of minimizing articulatory effort and maximizing perceptual distinct-
ness. The tension between these two goals is described in more detail in Textbox 3.4. One
```

```
important corollary of this compromise is that languages seek to exert effort only where
the perceptual payoff will be greatest. In contexts where the perceptual distinctness is
impoverished to begin with, effort will be minimized even if this further reduces perceptual
distinctness.
Let us again consider some data from Hupa. Recall that Hupa has a phonemic contrast
between aspirated and unaspirated stops. In fact, this contrast is limited to certain contexts;
it is not found at the end of roots, a position where there is usually no following vowel.
In root-final position, only unaspirated stops occur. This positional restriction against the
aspirated vs. unaspirated stop contrast is phonetically sensible; it is difficult to hear whether
a consonant is aspirated if it is not released into a following vowel. To make final aspiration
audible, a speaker would need to exert additional articulatory effort, such as creating a larger
laryngeal opening or using greater subglottal pressure to increase the aspiration noise. Even
with this additional effort, though, the contrast would still not be as perceptually salient as
when the stop is followed by a vowel. Rather than expend all of that articulatory effort for
a relatively small increase in perceptual distinctness, speakers have neutralized the contrast
between aspirated and unaspirated stops in root-final position. Speakers have thus simpli-
fied this aspect of the language, saving articulatory effort in the precise environment where
the payoff of perceptual distinctness would be minimal.
```
### TEXTBOX 3.4 THE CORRELATION BETWEEN PERCEPTUAL DISTINCTNESS AND

### ARTICULATORY EFFORT

```
The more articulatory effort we put into the production
of sounds, the more distinct they become. We need
to make distinctions in language so that we can
convey the myriad ideas that we use to communicate;
the more sounds we distinguish, the easier it will be
to differentiate among the thousands of words in a
language. The opposite pull – toward routinization,
rapidity, and ease of articulation – results in a saving of
articulatory effort, but a loss of perceptual distinctness.
```
```
Thus, we can see that these two forces are correlated:
```
```
Since we want greater perceptual distinctness but less
articulatory effort, the two forces are in conflict, pulling
in both directions and creating tensions that result in
complex phonological patterns.
```
3.2.5 Free Variation

```
We have seen that sounds can have different relationships in phonology. Some sounds
have contrastive distribution and are phonemes, while other sounds are in complemen-
tary distribution and are allophones. There is one more type of relationship that sounds
can have. A single sound can have two different variant pronunciations in the same
word. For example, there is more than one way to pronounce the final consonant in the
word bad without any change in meaning. One possible realization of the final [d] is with
a release, just like when [d] occurs before a vowel. Another possibility is for the final [d]
```
```

```

**71 3 Phonology**

```
to lack a release. The IPA symbol for an unreleased consonant is ଣ (written after the unre-
leased consonant). The two variants for bad are thus [bæd] and [bædଣ]. These two possible
realizations for word-final [d] are not limited to only the word bad but can occur for any
d-final word in English. Moreover, it is not only with [d] that this difference is found;
in general, English stops in word-final position may be either released or unreleased. For
example, bag can be pronounced either [bæg] or [bægଣ], tube can be pronounced either
[tʰub] or [tʰubଣ], cat can be realized either as [kʰæt] or [kʰætଣ], etc. This situation, in
which two different sounds occur in the same environment in the same word, is
called free variation. We can thus say that released and unreleased stops are in free
variation word-finally in English.
```
```
3.2.6 Allomorphy
We have seen that the English past-tense ending - ed has three different phonetic real-
izations that depend on the final consonant of the root. If the root-final consonant is
voiceless, the past tense is realized as [t], e.g., walked [wakt] or sipped [sɪpt]. If the root-final
consonant is voiced, the past tense surfaces as [d], e.g., robbed [ɹabd] or seized [sizd]. If the
final consonant is an alveolar stop or flap, the past tense is realized as [ԥd], e.g., rented
[ɹɛntԥd] or waited [weݐəd]. The past-tense ending, like any suffix, contains information that
is crucial to the interpretation of a word. The term for a meaningful part of a word that
cannot be further subdivided is a morpheme. All roots, suffixes, and prefixes are mor-
phemes, since they contribute meaning to the words in which they appear. Morphemes
are discussed further in Chapter 4 on morphology. For our purposes, what is crucial about
morphemes is that they often come in several phonetic variants, which are conditioned
by context. The morpheme variants that occur in complementary distribution are termed
allomorphs , just as variants of phonemes that occur in complementary distribution are
termed allophones. As we saw earlier for the past tense in English, allomorphs are often
conditioned by the same phonetic motivating forces that govern the occurrence of
allophones.
Suffixes and other affixes are not the only morphemes that may have allomorphs. It is pos-
sible for roots to have multiple allomorphs. For example, roots ending in /t/ in English have
different allomorphs depending on the context in which they occur. Consider the verb cite
which ends, when uttered in isolation, in an unaspirated /t/, either released or unreleased, as
we just saw in the discussion of free variation. If we add the adjectival suffix - able to the root
cite , the final /t/ changes from an alveolar stop to a flap (in American English). Thus, citeable
is pronounced as [ˈsaɪɾəbl̩ ] in American English. The flap is the regular realization of alveolar
stops between a stressed vowel and an unstressed vowel in American English. Because the
suffix - able is unstressed in the word citeable , this creates the proper environment for the
allomorph of cite that ends in a flap. A third allomorph arises when we add the suffix - ation to
cite to produce citation , pronounced [saܼˈtʰeݕnࡦ]. The /t/ at the end of the root is now realized as
an aspirated stop because the suffix - ation creates the correct environment for stop aspiration:
the position immediately before a stressed vowel. The root cite thus has three allomorphs
in total in American English (two in British English, which lacks the flap), differing in the
realization of the final consonant. One, ending in unaspirated [t], surfaces when there are no
```

**72 Matthew Gordon**

```
suffixes. Another, ending in a flap [ɾ], occurs in American English after a stressed vowel and
before an unstressed vowel. The third and final allomorph, ending in aspirated [tހ], occurs
before a stressed vowel. The allomorphs discussed here are summarized in Textbox 3.5.
```
### TEXTBOX 3.5 THE THREE ALLOMORPHS OF CITE

```
cite [sait] /t/ is realized as [t] in word-final position
cit-able [ˈsaɪɾ-əbl̩ ] /t/ is realized as [ɾ] following a stressed vowel in American English (but as /t/ in
British English)
cit-ation [saɪˈtʰ-eʃn̩] /t/ is aspirated [tʰ] before a stressed vowel
```
### TEXTBOX 3.6 COMMON PHONOLOGICAL PROCESSES

```
Allophonic and allomorphic variation are typically
triggered by the same phonological processes.
This is not surprising since allophones and
allomorphs tend to be phonetically motivated,
and speech physiology varies relatively little across
humans, regardless of their language background.
Similarly, the compromise between the two goals
of minimizing articulatory effort and maximizing
perceptual distinctness underlie the phonological
systems of all spoken languages, giving rise to the
same types of alternations. Some phonological
processes are especially common. It is helpful to
be familiar with these when doing phonological
analysis:
tAssimilation: one sound becomes like another sound,
e.g., Hupa vowel rounding or /n/ being pronounced
```
```
as [m] (so labial like the following [p]) in the English
word input.
tPalatalization: a subtype of assimilation in which a
velar or alveolar consonant is pronounced in the
palatal region when adjacent to a high vowel, a front
vowel, or the palatal glide, e.g., bet you pronounced
as betcha , or did you as did-ja.
tDissimilation: one sound becomes less like another
sound, e.g., Finnish vowel rounding, or some
pronunciations of the English word February as Feb[j]
uary , with the first of two /r/ sounds in the word
becoming a glide.
tMetathesis: two sounds are transposed, e.g., a
child’s pronunciation of animal as aminal , or
the common pronunciation of the (now retired)
football player Brett Favre’s name as Farve.
```
```
It is important to note that all of the rules responsible for the allomorphs of the root
cite are consistent rules of English that occur even in words for which there are not
multiple allomorphs. All voiceless stops are aspirated before stressed vowels (as in words
like peach, top , and kite ), and all alveolar stops between a vowel and an unstressed vowel
become a flap in American English (as in words like city, pity , and shadow ). This means
that other roots ending in /t/ will also have several allomorphs if they take suffixes with
the right shape to trigger rules such as aspiration or flapping. For example, the root wit
has an allomorph ending in unaspirated [t] when pronounced in isolation, and another
allomorph ending in a flap in the suffixed form witty in American English. The latter
allomorph is the result of a phonological process called lenition. For more on phono-
logical processes, see Textbox 3.6. For discussion of interesting dialectal variations of
word-final /ɹ/ in English, see Textbox 3.7.
```

**73 3 Phonology**

```
tDeletion: the loss of a sound, e.g., the loss of the
final /n/ in hymn (but not in the suffixed form
hymnal ), or the final /b/ in crumb (but not in the
suffixed form crumble ).
tInsertion: the insertion of a vowel between the
two consonants, e.g., in the past tense of English
words that end in alveolar stops, such as betted and
provided.
tFortition: the strengthening of a sound, e.g.,
word-initial aspiration in English or the fortition
```
```
of [s] to the affricate [ts] in words like English
dance.
tLenition: the weakening of a sound, e.g., the
loss of stop closure intervocalically in Spanish or the
realization of American English /t/ or /d/ as a flap.
tVowel reduction (a type of lenition): the conversion
of unstressed vowels to more schwa-like allophones,
e.g., the second vowel in emphasis , as compared
to emphatic , or the fourth vowel in anticipatory , as
compared to anticipate.
```
```
TEXTBOX 3.6 ( cont. )
```
### TEXTBOX 3.7 LINKING AND INTRUSIVE ‘R’ IN ENGLISH

```
Many speakers of English do not pronounce a final
/ɹ/ at the end of a word or phrase but retain the /ɹ/
before another morpheme or word beginning with a
vowel. For these speakers, the word lore would thus
be pronounced without /ɹ/ in isolation or before a
consonant but with the final /ɹ/ in the phrase lore and
science. This is an example of a deletion, where /ɹ/ is
deleted before a consonant or word boundary.
For many, this ‘linking-R’ has been generalized to
occur even in words that do not etymologically have
a final /ɹ/, e.g. law. For such speakers, the phrases
law and science and lore and science would be
```
```
pronounced the same. These speakers would thus not
have a rule deleting an /ɹ/ that is already there, but an
insertion rule, adding an /ɹ/ between one word that
ends in a vowel and another word that begins with
a vowel.
This ‘intrusive-R’ has even been extended for some
speakers to certain words produced in all contexts, e.g.,
idea , soda. For such speakers, these word forms would
not be derived by rule but would include the /ɹ/ in the
underlying phonemic representation of the word. These
examples illustrate how dialectal variation is created by
relatively minor changes in phonological systems.
```
```
3.2.7 Processes Triggered by Positioning, Stress, and Syllable-Type
The examples of cite and witty illustrate another important point: sometimes phonologi-
cal processes are triggered by the position of the sound in the word, while at other
times they are triggered by surrounding sounds. Word-initial and word-final positions
often trigger phonological processes. In many languages, syllable position and stress are two
additional contexts in which phonological rules apply. For example, consider the word from
Chickasaw in (3). In the phonetic transcription, stress is indicated by the IPA symbol [ޖ] and
syllable boundaries are represented by periods.
```
```
(3)
You will notice that the vowel /a/ is lengthened in the second and fourth syllables. This
is a regular phonological process in Chickasaw; vowels are lengthened in stressed syllables,
as long as they are not word-final. Thus, we see that both stress and position play roles in
this process.
Vowel lengthening in Chickasaw is actually more complicated than this, as the rule does
not target all non-final stressed syllables, but only those in open syllables , that is, those
```

syllables that end with a vowel. Therefore, the second vowel
in [tݕa.ˈlak.ˈki௧] ‘Cherokee’ does not lengthen even though it is
stressed. The second syllable in this word is a closed syllable ,
as it ends in a consonant, in this case /k/.
As it turns out, the distinction between open and closed syl-
lables is also relevant for describing the location of stress in
Chickasaw. In words that are made up of strings of open sylla-
bles, stress will fall on all even-numbered syllables and on the
last syllable of the word. We can see this pattern in the word [a.ˈsaː.bi.ˈkaː.ˈtݕi] ‘he or she
makes me sick.’ In contrast, closed syllables in Chickasaw are stressed regardless of whether
they are even-numbered or not, e.g., [ˈok.ˈfok.ˈkol] ‘type of snail.’ Thus, the distribution of
stress in Chickasaw depends on both positioning and syllable type.
```
### CHAPTER SUMMARY

```
We have learned about the ways in which the sounds of a language pattern together
in groups and form systematic relationships. There are three types of relationships
that can hold between sounds. One possibility is for two sounds to be in contrastive
distribution (the sounds occur in the same position in different words), in which case
the sounds are separate phonemes. A second possibility is for sounds to occur in the
same position in the same word, in which case they are said to be in free variation. A
final option is for two sounds to be in different predictable environments, in which
case the sounds are in complementary distribution and are allophones of the same
phoneme. Allophones can be conditioned by surrounding sounds, by stress (or lack
thereof), by certain positions in the syllable or word, or by some combination of these
factors.
The relationships between allophones and their underlying phonemes can be expressed
using phonological rules. Phonological rules are motivated by two competing forces:
ease of articulatory effort and perceptual distinctiveness, and these give rise to a variety
of phonological processes, many of them quite common. Phonological rules are thus
grounded in both the phonetic and the functional bases of human language.
In addition to mediating allophonic relationships, phonological rules help determine
relationships between allomorphs. The following chapter discusses morphology, including
alternations between allomorphs, in more detail.

**2.** For each of the following English words, think of another word from which it differs by only one phoneme –
    and with which it thus forms a minimal pair – and write it down, both in English spelling and in IPA. Then
    describe the phonetic dimension(s) on which the differing phonemes differ.
       **Example** : if given the word ‘muddle’ [ˈmʌdl̩], you could come up with
       ‘puddle’ [ˈpʌdl̩ ]. The two phonemes that differ are [m] and [p]. These
       phonemes have the same place of articulation (bilabial), but you would say
       that the dimensions on which they differ are manner (because [p] is an oral
       stop but [m] is a nasal stop) and voicing (because [m] is voiced but [p] is
       voiceless). You could also have come up with other words that form minimal
       pairs with ‘muddle,’ such as ‘middle’ [ˈmɪdlࡦ] or ‘muzzle’ [ˈmʌzlࡦ]; you would
       then have different phonetic differences to describe.

### CHAPTER PREVIEW

```
We have seen how sounds pattern in each language as they are combined to form words.
Morphology is the study of the internal structure of words. This chapter describes the kinds of
building blocks used to form words in different languages and the ways they can be combined.
Speakers are not usually conscious of the patterns inside of their words, but for most
languages, knowledge of such patterns is crucial to the ability to speak. Topics discussed here
include the notion of the word , the forms morphemes can take, the kinds of meanings they
can carry, how to identify and describe them, and what we can learn from the morphological
patterns we find. In the process, it introduces core grammatical concepts and analytical skills
that will be central to discussions of word classes, syntax, and other topics covered throughout
this book.
```

4.1 **Introduction to Morphology**

```
As speakers, what do we know about our mother tongue? Much of our linguistic knowledge
is unconscious. When we start to learn a new language, we often come to appreciate just
how much speakers must know in order to talk, whether they are aware of it or not.
It seems obvious that knowing words is a critical part of know-
ing a language, but what does it mean to know a word? A recent
newspaper advertisement claims Unbelievable weight loss break-
throughs! Most English speakers recognize each of the words in
this phrase as part of the vocabulary of English. They may or
may not realize that words can have meaningful parts of their
own. The first word, unbelievable , has three parts. It is based on
the verb root believe. With the addition of the ending -able , we
have another word believ-able ‘able to be believed.’ If we add un-
to that word believable , we have yet another word, this one with
the opposite meaning: un-believable ‘not able to be believed.’
Each of the meaningful parts of a word, like believe , - able , and
un -, is called a morpheme. The study of how morphemes are
combined to form new words is called morphology.
Morphology is one of the areas in which languages can differ the most from each
other. Compare the two sentences below. The first is from Engenni, a Kwa language
spoken in Nigeria. The top line in the example shows the sentence as it was spoken, the
second line shows the meaning of each word, and the third line shows a free translation
of the whole.
```
**(1)** Engenni (Thomas 1978)

```
Átanawa ɔ mù.
one go to seek house
‘Let’s go look for the house.’
```
```
The second example is from Mohawk, a language
of the Iroquoian family spoken in Quebec, Ontario,
and New York State. Here again the top line shows
the sentence as spoken; note that the whole sen-
tence is expressed in a single Mohawk word. The sec-
ond line shows the parts (morphemes) of the word.
The third identifies the meaning of each morpheme.
The fourth provides a free translation of the word as
a whole.

```
The Engenni and Mohawk sentences mean roughly the same thing, but the two languages
differ considerably in the way they distribute information over their words. In the Engenni
example, each word contains just one meaningful part, or one morpheme. In the Mohawk
example, all of the same information is packaged into a single word.
```
```
4.1.1 What Is a Word?
How do we know that the Mohawk sentence in (2) contains just one word? The most obvious
way to find out is to ask a speaker. Mohawk speakers have clear ideas about where one word
stops and the next begins, whether or not they have ever read or
written their language. All would readily agree that (2) is a single
word. Let’s look at a longer sentence. Compare the Mohawk
sentence in (3) with its English translation. The amount of
information contained in each word is different in Mohawk and
English: the Mohawk sentence contains seven words, and the
English translation fourteen. But all Mohawk speakers would
again divide the sentence into words in the same way.
```
```

FACTUAL-they-all-fruit-pick-go.and one-it-fruit-big-is
they went to pick fruit apple
to go pick apples.’
In some languages, the boundaries between some words are not as clear. For example, how
many words are there in the English term ice cream or ice-cream? As was noted in Chapter 1,
```
### SIDEBAR 4.3

```

```

**82 Marianne Mithun**

```
all languages change over time, and many aspects of languages change, including the
boundaries between words. When two or more words occur together very frequently in
speech, especially when they come to represent a single idea like ‘ice cream,’ speakers may
begin to process them as a single unit, rather than composing the expression anew, word by
word, each time they refer to it. The merging of words into a single cognitive unit can occur
gradually over time. It is in such cases of change in progress that speakers may be uncertain
of word boundaries.
Speaker intuitions usually provide the best indication of boundaries between words
(although in some cases standardized spelling conventions can interfere with intuitions).
But individual languages may provide additional kinds of evidence. In most languages,
words can be pronounced alone, but individual morphemes often cannot. For example,
if I asked you what English t means, you probably would not recognize it as the past tense
suffix at the end of look-ed [lݜk-t]. Similarly, the Mohawk morpheme - rh- ‘tree’ which is part
of the word ‘forest’ in (3) above, would never be pronounced by itself; speakers would not
even recognize it if it were.
Another indication of word boundaries is that speakers can pause between words. For
example, an English speaker may say: I ... don’t really want to. But speakers rarely if ever pause
between the morphemes inside of a word: thus Lightn ... ing was flashing in all direct ... ions
would be distinctly odd. This is true for Mohawk as well as for English. If Mohawk speak-
ers are interrupted in the middle of a word, they go back and start over at the beginning.
Speakers sometimes insert parenthetical information between words; thus I ... if you want to
know the truth ... don’t really want to would be possible. But speakers do not insert such asides
between morphemes; thus Lightn ... really scary ... ing was flashing would be impossible. This
suggests that words are not usually produced morpheme by morpheme as speakers talk;
words are stored as single cognitive units, and selected from memory as wholes for speech.
In many languages, it is easy to identify words on the basis of phonological evidence.
Perhaps the most obvious type of phonological evidence is the location of stress. In some
languages, primary stress regularly falls on a certain syllable. In Finnish, for example, stress
occurs on the first syllable of each word: aasi ‘donkey,’ perhonen ‘butterfly,’ välimatka ‘dis-
tance,’ valoku-vauskone ‘camera.’ In Spanish, primary stress (apart from specific exceptions)
falls on the second-to-last syllable: burro ‘donkey,’ mariposa ‘butterfly,’ biblioteca ‘library.’
Mohawk shows the same pattern as Spanish. The accent marks in the Mohawk examples in
(2) and (3) above indicate stressed syllables. Other types of phonological evidence can pro-
vide clues to the boundaries between words as well, though these
differ from language to language.
It is often the case that the ideas expressed by a single word in
one language can also be expressed, more or less, with multiple
words in the same language. But there are usually differences in
meaning, although they may be subtle. A number of the mor-
phemes in the Mohawk word in (4a) could be expressed with
separate words. If, for example, you and I had been looking for
something else beforehand, and I wanted us to shift the goal
of our search, it would be more appropriate to name the house
separately, as in (4b).
```
### SIDEBAR 4.4

```
The term stress was introduced in
Section 2.7.2. It refers to the relative
prominence of a syllable in the word.
A syllable with primary stress will
often have special pitch, it may be
louder, and it may last longer than
a syllable with secondary stress or a
syllable that is unstressed.

I blackened
b. Sápa waká÷e. ‘I made it/them black.’
black I made
When asked about the difference, the speaker, Mr. Redbird,
explained that if he had just polished his boots he would use (5a).
If he had hung a kettle over the fire to start a stew cooking, then
returned some time later to find that the flames had come up and
eventually left soot on the bottom of the kettle, he would use (5b).
The first sentence indicates a single, direct action, while the second is
appropriate for a longer string of events and indirect consequences.
```
4.2 **Kinds of Morphemes**

```
Morphemes, the building blocks of words, can be classified in
several ways. One distinction is between free morphemes and
bound morphemes. Free morphemes are those that can stand
alone as words.
In the English phrase we saw at the outset, the morphemes
believe, weight, loss, break , and through are all free, because they
can be used as words on their own. All of the morphemes in the
Engenni sentence in (1) are free: á ‘one,’ ta ‘go,’ na ‘to,’ wa ‘seek,’
and omù ‘house.’ In the Mohawk sentence in (3), the words ó:nen ‘now’ and ki ’ ‘in fact’
are free. Bound morphemes are morphemes that never occur as words on their own. The
English morphemes un- and -s are both bound.
Another way to classify morphemes is into roots and affixes. Roots are considered the
foundation of the word. The root usually conveys the main meaning of the word. The root
of un-believ-able , for example, is believe. Affixes are morphemes that attach to roots and mod-
ify their meaning in some way. The morphemes un -, - able , and - s are all affixes. Affixes never
stand alone as words; they are bound. Textbox 4.1 discusses the relationship between the
concepts of root versus affix and free versus bound.
```
### SIDEBAR 4.6

```
A hyphen on the left of a morpheme,
as in the English plural - s , indicates
that the morpheme must attach
to something on its left. A hyphen
on the right, as in un-, indicates
that the morpheme must attach
to something on its right. Bound
morphemes are always written with
a hyphen on at least one side.
```

**84 Marianne Mithun**

```
Affixes can also be classified according to where they occur: before the root, after the root,
on both sides of the root, or inside the root. We can see each of these kinds of affixes in
Ilocano, a language of the Austronesian family spoken in the Philippines.
A prefix is a type of affix that appears before the root, like the English un- of un-
believable. Compare the Ilocano words in the left column in (6) with those on the right.
```
**(6)** Ilocano prefix (Rubino 1997)

```
amianan ‘north’ taga-amianan ‘Northerner’
abagatan ‘south’ taga-abagatan ‘Southerner’
bantay ‘mountain’ taga-bantay ‘from the mountains’
ili ‘town’ taga-ili ‘from town’
Amerika ‘America’ taga-amerika ‘American’
The prefix taga- forms words for origin or nationality from words for places.
A suffix is a type of affix that occurs after the root, like the English - able of unbeliev-able.
Compare the Ilocano words in the left column in (7) with those on the right.
```
**(7)** Ilocano suffix (Rubino 1997)

```
giling ‘grind’ giling-an ‘grinder’
sagat ‘strain’ sagat-an ‘strainer’
balkot ‘wrap’ balkot-an ‘wrapper’
timbeng ‘weigh’ timbeng-an ‘balance, scale’
Adding the suffix - an to a verb can create a noun in Ilocano.
Affixes that create nouns are called nominalizers. The nouns
in (7) designate instruments. This particular suffix can thus be
called an instrumental nominalizer.
An infix is a type of affix that appears inside of the root.
```
**(8)** Ilocano infix (Rubino 1997)

```
kuton ‘ant’ k-in-uton ‘ant-infested’
gayaman ‘centipede’ g-in-ayaman ‘infested with centipedes’
ngilaw ‘fly’ ng-in-ilaw ‘fly-infested’
kuto ‘lice’ k-in-uto ‘lice-infested’
The Ilocano infix -in- adds the meaning ‘infested.’ When we describe an infix, we always
specify where in the root it is inserted. Here the infix is inserted after the first consonant of
the noun: k-in-uton ‘ant-infested.’ (The sequence of letters ng is used in the practical spelling
```

```
### TEXTBOX 4.1 ROOTS VERSUS AFFIXES AND FREE VERSUS BOUND

```
Can we say that all roots are free morphemes, and
that all affixes are bound? The answers to these
two questions are no and yes. In English, most
roots are free, that is, they can occur as words on
their own, like believe. But in Mohawk, most roots
```
```
are bound, like - nonhs - ‘house,’ - ihsak ‘seek,’ - rh -
‘tree,’and - takhe ‘run’: that is, they always take
affixes and never occur as words on their own.
Affixes, on the other hand, are bound by definition
in all languages.
```

**85 4 Morphology**

```
system to represent a velar nasal [ƾ], a single consonant.) Infixes are much rarer in the lan-
guages of the world than prefixes and suffixes.
Circumfixes wrap around the root, with part occurring before and part after. English
does not have circumfixes; the example below is from Ilocano:
```
```
(9) Ilocano circumfix (Rubino 1997)
ragsak ‘happy’ pag-ragsak-en ‘make someone happy’
leddaang ‘sad’ pag-leddaang-en ‘make someone sad’
uray ‘wait’ pag-uray-en ‘make someone wait’
awid ‘go home’ pag-awid-en ‘make someone go home’
The Ilocano circumfix pag -...- en adds the meaning ‘make’ or ‘cause.’ It is called a causa-
tive. For an example of another circumfix, see Textbox 4.2.
Words may contain more than one prefix, more than one suffix, or combinations of both, as
in many of the Mohawk words seen earlier, one of which is repeated in (10). The root is in bold.
```
```
(10) Mohawk verb from (3)
niahatitakhenóntie’
n-i-a-ha-ti- takhe -n-ontie’
there-thither-FACTUAL-3.MASCULINE-all- run -to.there-along
‘they started running thither into it’
```
```
It is important to note that there are no infixes in this word. The morphemes n - ‘there,’
i - ‘thither,’ a - FACTUAL, ha - the 3rd-person masculine, and ti- ‘all’ are all prefixes, because
they all occur before the root. No morpheme appears inside of the root - takhe ‘run.’ Many
languages, among them Turkish and the Eskimo-Aleut languages, have only suffixes. Some
others, among them Navajo and many other Athabaskan languages, have only prefixes.
Most languages, like English, French, or Japanese, have both.
Words may also contain more than one root. Such words are called compounds.
English is particularly rich in compounds. English speakers frequently combine roots, even
full words, to create new words, such as break-through, pig-pen, hot-dog , and many more.
Frequently used word-formation processes are said to be highly productive ; this concept
is further discussed in Textbox 4.3. Newer compounds are often still written as two words,
even when they are pronounced and understood as a term for a single idea. The Mohawk
example seen earlier in (4a) is also a compound, built on the noun root - nonhs - ‘house’ and
the verb root - ihsak ‘seek’: teni - nonhs-ihsák-ha ‘Let’s go house-hunting.’
```
### STOP AND REFLECT 4.1 COMPOUNDS AND WORD MEANINGS

```
Consider the following two sentences:
a. She studied f lower arranging in Japan.
b. She carefully put the f lower in her hair.
In (a) the word f lower is put into the compound f lower arranging. In (b) it is used independently. What are
the differences in meaning between the two? Could the compound flower arranging be used for arranging
flowers in one’s hair? Why or why not?
```

**86 Marianne Mithun**

### TEXTBOX 4.2 CIRCUMFIXES

```
Circumfixes, like infixes, are relatively rare among the
languages of the world. Often they originated as a
combination of a prefix and a suffix that, over time,
came to have a meaning of its own. In Example (7) we
saw the suffix -an that is used to form nouns in Ilocano.
Ilocano now has several circumfixes that form terms for
```
```
places, which must have originated as a combination of
some prefix with the nominalizer suffix -an. The locative
nominalizer pag-...-an creates names of places from verbs
that denote the kind of activity typically done there. The
locative nominalizer ka-...-an creates names of places from
words for activities or objects characteristic of those places.
```
```
TABLE 4.1 Ilocano locative nominalizers (Rubino 1997)
adal ‘study’ pag-adal-an ‘school’
```
```
langoy ‘swim’ pag-langoy-an ‘swimming pool’
```
```
pabuya ‘show’ pag-pabuya-an ‘theater’
```
```
sugal ‘gamble’ pag-sugal-an ‘casino’
```

darat ‘sand’ ka-darat-an ‘sandy place’

```
```
pinia ‘pineapple’ ka-pinia-an ‘pineapple field’
```
```
mangga ‘mango’ ka-mangga-an ‘mango plantation’
```
### TEXTBOX 4.3 PRODUCTIVITY

```
Productive morphological processes are those that
speakers use to create new words. Noun-noun
compounding is very productive in English: it is a
constant source of new words. Some affixes are highly
productive as well, like the nominalizer -ness of words
like shortsighted-ness. Others are less productive,
```
```
like the nominalizer -hood in woman-hood. Some are
no longer productive at all, like the nominalizer - t
of weigh-t. To see just how productive noun-noun
compounding is in English, listen to the speech
around you for a noun-noun compound that is new
to you.
```
4.3 **Finding Morphemes: Morphological Analysis**

```
How do we know what the morphemes are in a particular word? Speakers themselves are
rarely conscious of morphological structure unless they have studied grammar. They obvi-
ously have some unconscious knowledge of morphology – we see this when they create
new words – but few could explain it. If we cannot ask speakers about morphology, how
can we discover it in a language?
Morphological analysis is usually done by comparing sets of words, as we did for the
Ilocano examples on the last several pages. If we find two similar words, one with a
particular sequence of sounds and one without it, we can compare the meanings
```

**87 4 Morphology**

```
of the words and hypothesize that the additional sequence of sounds adds the
additional meaning. Consider the following examples from English:
```
```
(11) English word pairs
happy cool
unhappy uncool
The meanings of the words with un - are the opposite of those without. We can hypothesize
that English has a prefix un - meaning ‘not.’
Now examine the pairs of words below from Karo, a language of the Tupi-Guaraní family
spoken in the Brazilian Amazon.
```
```
(12) Karo verbs (Gabas 1999)
k ə ‘walk’
tak ə ‘make (someone) walk while walking alongside of him or her’
ket ‘sleep’
taket ‘put (someone) to sleep and sleep alongside him or her’
noga ‘eat’
tanoga ‘feed (someone) while eating with him or her’
Each of these verbs can occur with or without the element ta. The addition of ta to the verbs
changes their meaning in a systematic way. It looks like we have a morpheme: a recurring
sequence of sounds ( ta ) with a recurring meaning. As far as we can tell from the data in
(12), this morpheme never appears on its own as a word: it is bound. Since it appears before
roots (rather than after them or inside of them), it is a prefix. Semantically, it adds a sense of
causation, causing someone to walk, causing someone to sleep, and causing someone to eat.
It is thus a causative. But it adds a more specific meaning than the Ilocano causative we saw
earlier. Here the causer is also participating in the caused activity: walking, sleeping, or eat-
ing. These examples illustrate an important principle of morphological analysis. We cannot
expect that every word in the free translation will correspond to a specific morpheme
in the language under analysis. Skillful morphological analysis can require the ability to
think beyond the translation to imagine what the actual meaning might be. (Linguists gen-
erally use the term gloss rather than “translation,” because they recognize that morphemes
and words in one language do not always have perfect semantic equivalents in another. A
gloss is simply the best approximation to the meaning. See Textbox 4.4 for important con-
ventions used in linguistics when writing out examples with morphological detail.)
```
### TEXTBOX 4.4 GLOSSING CONVENTIONS

```
We write the gloss of a morpheme in small caps if it
is a grammatical term like PLURAL (PL), NEGATIVE (NEG),
CAUSATIVE (CAUS), or NOMINALIZER (NMLZ). Translations
are written between single quotation marks, whether
it is the translation for a single morpheme, like the
```
```
Mohawk suffix -ontie’ ‘along’ in example (10), or an
entire word or sentence, such as ‘they started running
thither into it.’
Words in the language under study are usually given
in italics, or, when handwritten, underlined.
```

**88 Marianne Mithun**

```
In conducting morphological analysis, we may not always
find pairs of words like those in (11) and (12): one without an
affix and one with it. Fortunately, there is another strategy for
detecting morphemes. We may find sets of words that all con-
tain a particular element, or a certain sequence of sounds. We
can then compare the meanings of those words to see what they
have in common. When a recurring form matches up with
a recurring meaning, we can hypothesize that we have a
morpheme with that form and that meaning.
Compare the Karo words in (13).
```
**(13)** Karo verbs (Gabas 1999)

```
oya ʔ wan ‘I left’
omãmnoy ‘I saw myself’
owakán ‘I am angry’
ok ə t ‘I walked’
All of these words begin with o , though otherwise they are different. One involves leaving,
one seeing, one being angry, and one walking. One is in the present, and the others are in the
past. But all include the meaning ‘I.’ We can hypothesize that o- is a morpheme meaning ‘I.’

### STOP AND REFLECT 4.2 SPANISH ADJECTIVES

```
Procedures for Morphological Analysis
In Spanish, the form of an adjective changes depending on the properties of the noun it describes. Consider
the adjectives that would modify the nouns indicated in each column.
niño ‘boy’ niña ‘girl’ niños ‘boys’ niñas ‘girls’
alto alta altos altas
chaparro chaparra chaparros chaparras
contento contenta contentos contentas
enojado enojada enojados enojadas
Use the methods described here – looking for additional sounds that indicate additional meanings and
recurring forms that correspond to recurring meanings – to analyze these adjectives. How many morphemes
occur in each adjective? Check your answers in Sidebar 4.9 on page 90.
```
4.4 **The Meanings of Morphemes**

```
Do all languages express the same kinds of meanings in their morphemes? There certainly
are similarities. Many languages have noun roots meaning ‘head,’ ‘fish,’ and ‘house,’ just as
in English. Many have verb roots meaning ‘eat,’ ‘catch,’ and ‘kill.’
But languages also show differences in their inventories of roots. Roots can have quite
different meanings in different languages. Central Alaskan Yup’ik, an Eskimo-Aleut lan-
guage spoken in southwestern Alaska, has roots for ‘head’ ( nasquq ) and ‘house’ ( ca ), like

the languages in Table 4.2. But the Yup’ik root neqe - ‘fish’ also means ‘food’ and ‘eat.’
Furthermore, for many Yup’ik roots, there are simply no English roots with equiva-
lent meanings. They can only be translated into English with complex explanations, as
shown in (14). (The Yup’ik material in this chapter comes from the speech of Elizabeth
Charles, Elena Charles, and George Charles, and from Jacobson (1985).)
```
```

pay’u- ‘to have one’s legs so cramped by cold that one cannot move’
qapiar- ‘to skin a seal or other animal starting from the head and pulling the skin back over

taarri- ‘to swat oneself or another in a steambath to tone muscles and stimulate sweating’
caqvir- ‘having shoes on the wrong feet’
narurte- ‘to act against accepted standards of behavior’
```
```
When we compare the meanings of affixes across languages, we find the same kinds of
similarities and differences. Some affix meanings show up in language after language. For
example, many languages have past-tense affixes, comparable to English - ed. Many have
```

**90 Marianne Mithun**

```
plural affixes, comparable to English - s. Many have nominalizers, like the English suffix
-er and like the Ilocano suffix - an we saw in giling-an ‘grind-er.’ Many have causatives like
the Ilocano circumfix in pag-ragsak-en ‘make someone happy.’ There are also interesting
differences in the meanings of affixes; some examples are discussed in Textbox 4.5.
```
```
Like roots, affix meanings can also vary across languages. Some interesting examples from
Yup’ik are given in (15).
```

```
### TEXTBOX 4.5 THE MEANINGS OF AFFIXES

```
Although different languages can have similar affix
categories, languages exhibit interesting differences.
Some languages have no affixes that mark past
tense, while others have elaborate sets of past-tense
affixes, distinguishing degrees of remoteness, such
as ‘immediate past,’ ‘recent past,’ ‘remote past,’
and ‘mythic past.’ Karo has a basic causative prefix
ma- , as in ket ‘sleep,’ ma-ket ‘put someone to sleep’;
k ə t ‘walk,’ ma-k ə t ‘make someone walk’; cop ɨ t ‘be
```
```
fat,’ ma-cop ɨ t ‘ make someone fat.’ But as we saw, it
also has a more specialized kind of causative prefix
ta- meaning ‘cause and participate in the action.’
Yup’ik has an unusually rich array of causative suffixes,
which differ in sometimes subtle ways. They add
meanings such as ‘let,’ ‘allow,’ ‘permit,’ ‘compel,’
‘force,’ ‘deliberately or intentionally cause,’ ‘try to
cause,’ ‘tend to cause,’ and ‘wait for’ (as in ‘wait for
something to boil’).
```
### SIDEBAR 4.10

```

constructions, see the South Conchucos

### SIDEBAR 4.9

```
Answers to Stop and Reflect 4.2: The adjectives
in the first two columns have two morphemes
each: the root ( alt ‘tall,’ chaparr ‘short,’ content
‘happy,’ and enojad ‘angry’) and a gender
suffix ( -o MASCULINE and -a FEMININE). The
adjectives in the third and forth columns have
three morphemes each, those in the first two
columns plus an additional suffix, -s PLURAL.
```

**91 4 Morphology**

```
The affixes that develop in languages are no accident. They grow out of distinctions that
speakers have chosen to express most often in daily speech, over generations, centuries,
even millennia. Some affixes reflect concepts that are important to human beings all over
the world, like causation. Others reflect the environmental and cultural concerns of indi-
vidual societies.
```
4.5 **The Shapes of Morphemes**

```
A single morpheme can have more than one pronunciation. Let’s consider English plu-
rals. If we look just at written English, it seems that to form a plural, we just add - s.
```
### SIDEBAR 4.11

```
Yup’ik IPA Phonetic description
e [ə] mid-central vowel
ng [ŋ] velar nasal
ll [ɬ] voiceless lateral fricative
g [ɣ] voiced velar fricative
q [q] voiceless uvular stop
r [ʀ] voiced uvular trill
```
### TEXTBOX 4.7 MEANINGS IN ROOTS AND AFFIXES

```
Meanings are not always distributed between roots
and affixes as we might expect. What is expressed by
a root in one language might be indicated by an affix
in another. Consider the Yup’ik word below, which is a
sentence in itself.
Iruartaa.
iru-art-a-a
leg-hit.in-TR.IND-3SG/3SG
‘She hit him in the leg.’
```
```
This verb has just one root, iru - ‘leg.’ We might expect
‘hit’ to be conveyed by a root as well, but here it is
conveyed by the suffix - art -. But how do we know that
```
- _art_ - really is a suffix? In Yup’ik, every noun and verb
begins with one and only one root. Only roots can occur
at the beginning of a word, and they always appear at
the beginning. All other morphemes in the word are
suffixes. Suffixes never appear at the beginning of a
word; they can occur only after a root or another suffix.

```
The verb mer-tar - is used, for example, for getting water
from a river. For getting water from a faucet or barrel, a
different suffix, - ssaag -, is used.
It’s important to note that meanings conveyed by roots
in one language might be conveyed by affixes in another
and vice versa. Examples are given in Textbox 4.7.
```
### TEXTBOX 4.6 YUP’IK IN USE

skink skink-s
toad toad-s
frog frog-s
tadpole tadpole-s
chameleon chameleon-s
salamander salamander-s
iguana iguana-s
gecko gecko-s
But do all these suffixes really sound the same? Try pronouncing the plural words carefully,
and listen to the sounds at the end. You will note that some words end in voiceless [s], and
some end in voiced [z]. Since we know these sounds are distinct phonemes in English, due
to minimal pairs such as sip and zip , we will describe the different forms of the English plural
as /s/ and /z/, using phonemic slashes.
When English speakers hear a new noun, they automati-
cally know which form to use for the plural. For example, what
word would you use to talk about more than one swip? How
about more than one grib? English speakers automatically use
the voiceless /s/ with swips , and the voiced /z/ with gribs , even
though they have never heard these words before.
If we look carefully at where each form occurs, we see a pattern. The voiceless plural /s/
comes after nouns ending in p, t , and k. The voiced plural /z/ comes after nouns ending in
d, g, l, n, r, w, y , and vowels. We can make a generalization about these contexts: the form
/s/ occurs only after voiceless sounds, and the form /z/ occurs only after voiced sounds. The
alternate forms of a morpheme, like the /s/ and /z/ plural here, are called allomorphs.
It is important to describe the different allomorphs and where each occurs. For our plural
allomorphs, we have two forms so far.
-s PLURAL
/s/ used after voiceless sounds
/z/ used after voiced sounds
```

pairs, see Section 3.2.1.
```
### TEXTBOX 4.8 PARALLEL RULE WRITING IN PHONOLOGY AND MORPHOLOGY

```
You will note that the way that rules are written in
morphology is similar to how they are written in
phonology, as you saw in Chapter 3. In phonology, the
```
```
rules represent the relationship between phonemes
and allophones; in morphology, they represent the
relationship between morphemes and allomorphs.
```
```
A description like that in (17) is called item and arrangement : we specify how the
items are arranged, that is, where each allomorph occurs.
```
### (17)


**93 4 Morphology**

```
Allomorphy can be also described in another style, called item and process , using
rule-writing conventions similar to those we saw in the chapter on phonology (see Textbox
4.8). To say that the plural suffix becomes voiced after a voiced sound, we begin with the basic
allomorph, here -s. We then add an arrow ĺ for ‘becomes’ or ‘is pronounced.’ To the right
of the arrow, we specify how it changed (in this case by becoming voiced). Next is a slash /,
which announces that the context is coming up. The blank __ shows us where the sound in
question fits into the context. Example (18) shows you this formal rule and how the same
meaning is conveyed in regular English prose.
```
```
(18) Formal and prose versions of the English plural allomorphy rule
-s ĺ [+voiced] / [+voiced] __
“ The English plural -s becomes voiced after any voiced sound.”
```
```
Are /s/ and /z/ the only allomorphs of the English plural? What is the plural of grouse?
How about thrush, finch , and partridge? Many English speakers would have a hard time iden-
tifying these four distinct species of birds, but all of them would pronounce the plurals of
the species names as /əz/. This is the third allomorph (along with /s/ and /z/) of the English
plural. The voicing rule we worked out in (18) doesn’t account for this new form. The nouns
grouse, thrush, finch , and partridge all end in hissing fricatives or affricates called stridents
or sibilants. We can thus expand the rule in (18) to include this other allomorph, which
occurs in a distinct phonological context.
```
```
(19) Expanded rule for English plural allomorphs
-s ĺ əz / [+strident] __
-s ĺ [+voiced] / [+voiced] __
```
### STOP AND REFLECT 4.3 COMPARING PATTERNS OF ALLOMORPHY IN ENGLISH

```
Compare the factors triggering the allomorphs of the English plural -s with those triggering the allomorphs
of the English past tense -ed (summarized in Section 3.2.6). In what ways are the patterns similar or different?
What does this tell you about the forces that motivate allomorphic variation?
```
```
Allomorphs develop for different reasons. In the case of the English plural, phonetic forces
motivate the alternations. When speakers already have their vocal folds vibrating to produce a
voiced sound at the end of a noun, it would take extra work to interrupt the vibration and cut
off the voicing in order to produce a voiceless /s/. It is easier to just let the vibration continue
to the end of the word. This is thus a case of assimilation (discussed in Section 3.1), whereby
adjacent sounds come to share a phonetic property, in this case voicing. This allomorphy
reduces articulatory effort. Now consider the other allomorph, /əz/, which we find after stri-
dents. If we pronounced the plural of grouse with just /s/, it would be nearly impossible to hear
the suffix: [graݜss]. The added vowel helps listeners identify the presence of the plural mor-
pheme, in other words, it adds to its perceptual salience. As we saw in Chapter 3, minimizing
articulatory effort and maximizing perceptual distinctness are opposing forces that
shape phonological systems; we also see their impact in allomorphic variation.
```

**94 Marianne Mithun**

```
Now what about the plurals cactus/cacti, phenomenon/phenom-
ena , and cherub/cherubim? Although these appear to be random
irregularities and they are indeed exceptions to our rule, there are
reasons why they exist. These nouns were borrowed into English
from other languages: Latin, Greek, and Hebrew, respectively.
The English speakers who originally adopted them brought their
plural forms along with them. The suffix - i in cact-i is a Latin plu-
ral, the suffix - a is a Greek plural, and the suffix - im is a Hebrew
plural. When enough nouns have been borrowed into one
language from another, and their plural forms have been brought in along with
them, speakers may begin to discern this pattern and apply it to new forms they
encounter with the same endings. If English speakers want to pluralize a word ending in
```
- _us_ (which happens to be a singular ending in Latin), they may decide that it should follow
the same pattern as _cactus_ and pluralize it with - _i_ , even if they have not heard its plural
form and don’t know whether it came from Latin. Textbox 4.9 further explains this process.

### SIDEBAR 4.13

```
The process of borrowing forms
from one language into another and
the impact that may have on the
borrowing language are extensively
discussed in Section 13.2.
```
### TEXTBOX 4.9 THE BATTLE OF THE PATTERNS

```
Not all nouns adopted from Latin into English have - i
plurals. The plurals of virus and census , for example, are
virus-es and census-es. This comes about since human
beings are masters at detecting patterns, in language
and elsewhere. The patterns come into play as we
```
```
speak. The result can be regularization and elimination
of exceptions. The plurals of virus and census have been
remodeled in accordance with the major pattern of
plural formation in English.
```
### STOP AND REFLECT 4.4 PLURALS OF ENGLISH NOUNS ENDING IN -US

```
The English singular nouns below all end in the sequence - us. Try pronouncing their plurals. To the best of
your ability, note which ones require that the plural be -i , which ones never take - i , and which ones allow
either - i or -es. Then go online and check their etymologies. Do all the words that allow -i originate in Latin?
alumnus, corpus, hippopotamus, minibus, octopus, papyrus, sarcophagus, walrus
```
```
We have seen two kinds of allomorphy. The plural allomorphs - s , - z , and - Ωz are pho-
nologically conditioned. The choice of which allomorph to use depends on the sound
before it: /ԥz/ is used after stridents, /s/ after other voiceless sounds, and /z/ after other
voiced sounds. The plural allomorphs - i, -a , and - im are lexically conditioned. The forms
are associated with particular words (or lexemes ).
Now let’s look at allomorphy in another language. Ilocano has a prefix that can form
verbs meaning ‘move an object to the location specified by the root.’
```
**(20)** Ilocano verbalizer

```
sakmol ‘inside of mouth’ i-sakmol ‘put something into the mouth’
ruar ‘outside’ i-ruar ‘take something outside’
```

**95 4 Morphology**

```
ditoy ‘here’ i-ditoy ‘put something here’
ngato ‘high, up’ i-ngato ‘put something up’
baba ‘down, below’ i-baba ‘put something down’
abut ‘hole’ y-abut ‘put something in a hole’
uneg ‘inside’ y-uneg ‘put something inside’
abay ‘side’ y-abay ‘place beside, compare’
```
```
Ilocano thus has a verbalizer prefix i -: it turns words into verbs. Compare each word
with its verbalized counterpart. You will note that when we reach the pair abut ‘hole,’
yabut ‘put something in a hole,’ we see a change in the shape of the prefix from i- to y-.
(The letter y in the Ilocano spelling system represents a palatal glide, IPA [j].) The forms
i - and y - appear in the same position in the word, immediately before the root, and they
contribute the same meaning. These facts together suggest that we have one morpheme
with two allomorphs.
```
### STOP AND REFLECT 4.5 WATCH ALLOMORPHY EMERGE

```
Try pronouncing the sequence i-abay slowly, and then repeat it a number of times quickly. You will note that
with speed, the vowel naturally turns into a glide as the sounds blend together. Articulatory “shortcuts” that
facilitate articulation are one way that allomorphs develop in languages over time.
```
```
When it appears that we have two (or more) allomorphs, we look to see where each
one occurs. When we have phonologically conditioned allomorphs, the distribution of
allomorphs is usually determined by the sounds directly preceding or following them.
Since there is nothing before our prefix here, the most promising place to look is after it.
We find:
i- before s, r, d, ng, b
y- before a, u
(Recall that ng is a digraph representing the single consonant [ŋ].) Can we make any gen-
eralizations about the context, as we did for the English plural? The i - occurs only before
consonants, and the y - only before vowels. This situation is called complementary dis-
tribution. In Chapter 3, we saw allophones of a single phoneme in complementary distri-
bution; we now see that allomorphs of a single morpheme can also have this relationship.
The two forms of our prefix never occur in the same context, a confirmation that we do
have allomorphs. We can now describe our prefix with its allomorphs.
```
```
(21) Formal and prose versions of the Ilocano verbalizer allomorphy rule
i- ĺ y / __ V
“The Ilocano prefix i- is pronounced as /y/ before a vowel.”
```
```
Note that allomorphic variation is not only found with affixes; roots can have allo-
morphs as well. Compare English leaf and leaves. The root has two forms: /lif/ in the
singular and /liv/ in the plural.

4.6 **Are Affixes Always Segments of a Word?**

```
Consider the English nouns mouse/mice and man/men. These plurals are irregular, but they
are not random. They are the result of a sequence of developments in the history of the
English language, each of which made sense at the time. But how do we describe these plu-
rals today? Do these forms have a plural affix? The answer is yes, but this affix has a different
character from the prefixes, suffixes, infixes, and circumfixes we have seen. Here the plural
affix cannot be described as one or more segments (consonants or vowels) but as a change
internal to the root. Sometimes affixes are simply changes in a form, not necessarily
added segments. This is true of the plurals of mouse and man : in both, plurality is signaled
by a change in the vowel, not the addition of a new vowel. This is also true of the past tense
on verbs like see/saw and run/ran.
Such allomorphy is lexically conditioned, because these changes could not be predicted on
the basis of the sounds of the roots alone but must be learned as properties of individual words.
Now compare the Engenni verbs in (22). The marks over the vowels indicate tone. The
absence of a mark indicates high tone, and a grave accent (è) indicates low tone.
```
**(22)** Engenni (Thomas 1978)

```
dire ‘cook’
dìre ‘cooks’
dirè ‘will cook’
The verb dire ‘cook’ alone has high tone on both syllables (HH).
The word dìre ‘cooks’ has low tone on the first syllable and high
tone on the second (LH). The future form dirè ‘will cook’ has high
tone on the first syllable and low on the second (HL). Here, too, it
is easier to describe the tenses as changes made to the root than
as pieces of words. The present-tense affix is an LH tone structure,
while the future-tense affix is an HL structure.
```
4.7 **Words, Lexemes, and Lexicalization**

```
At the beginning of this chapter, we considered how to identify words in an unfamiliar
language. We can now take this question a bit further. Consider the English words lizard
and lizards. We know that they are different words. But we would not expect to find both
in a dictionary; we will find only lizard. The same is true of the words talk, talked , and
talking. They are all different words, but we will find only talk in the dictionary. Words
like lizard and lizards are said to belong to the same lexeme. Similarly, talk, talked , and
talking belong to the same lexeme. The plural suffix - s on lizard does not form a new
vocabulary item; it simply gives us another form of the same one, used for referring to
more than one of the item denoted by the word. A lexeme is a basic vocabulary item,
something we might find as an entry in a dictionary (or in our mental lexicon).
Morphology that does not form a new lexeme, like the plural - s on nouns and - ed and - ing
on verbs, is called inflection. Inflectional affixes never change the word class of the word

that they attach to. Gavotte is a noun, and the plural gavotte-s is still a noun. Inflectional
affixes tend to be highly productive. If we learn a new English count noun like gavotte , we
expect that it will have a plural, though we may not always be able to predict the form of
the plural. Inflectional affixes tend to contribute predictable meanings. If we know
that the noun gavotte means ‘a medium-paced dance popular in the eighteenth century,’ we
may never have heard it in the plural, but we can predict that gavotte-s will mean more than
one gavotte. For examples of some inflectional affixes in English, see Textbox 4.10.

Languages differ in the meanings expressed in their inflectional morphology, though
certain inflectional categories appear in language after language. Plural and tense inflection
are both common cross-linguistically. Another common kind of inflectional morphology
is case. To see what case morphology can do, look at the Latvian sentences given in (23).

```
```
Each of the nouns occurs in several sentences. Now look more closely at the forms of these
nouns. Start with the word for ‘field.’ In (23a) it is laukƗ , but in (23b) it is lauks. Look at the
words for ‘bird.’ In (23c) it is putns , in (23d) it is putnƗ , and in (23e) it is putnu. Take a moment
to see whether you can tell why the forms keep changing. The other nouns show similar
changes.
Each Latvian noun here contains a suffix that identifies its role in the sentence. These
suffixes are what are termed case-markers. For example, the ending - s indicates that the
noun is the subject.
The word putn-s ‘bird’ is the subject of (23c) ‘The bird is eating the worm.’ Morphemes
that identify subjects, like this - s , are called nominative case-markers. The word putn-u
‘bird’ is the direct object of (23e): ‘The man is eating the bird.’ Morphemes that identify
objects, like the - u , are called accusative case-markers. The word putn-Ɨ specifies a location
in (23d): ‘The worm lives in the bird.’ The - Ɨ is a locative case suffix. Case morphology
occurs in languages all over the world, though certainly not in
every language. Languages that do have case morphology show
fascinating variation in the number and functions of their case
categories. Latvian itself has other case categories in addition to
those shown here.
Not all morphology is inflectional. Morphological processes
that create new lexemes are derivational. From the root self , a
new lexeme was created early in the current century: self-ie ‘pho-
tograph that one takes of oneself.’ This suffix - ie is not fully pro-
ductive: there are many nouns that speakers would not add it to.
Can you imagine a word window-ie? Derivational affixes do
not necessarily add predictable meaning. If you only knew
the root self , would you be able to predict that the meaning of
selfie would be related to photography?
Derivational morphology can change the word class
of the lexeme it is applied to , though this is not always the
case. (See Textbox 4.11 for some examples of derivational affixes
in English.) The nominalizers and verbalizers we saw earlier in
this chapter are derivational affixes. Added to the English verb
govern , the derivational suffix - ment creates a new noun: govern-
ment. Added to the Yup’ik noun imarpig ‘sea,’ the derivational suffix -kuar - ‘go by way of’
creates a new verb: imarpig-kuar - ‘go by sea.’
Speakers recognize the difference between those words that already exist in their lan-
guage and those that could but have not yet been created. This knowledge is sometimes
referred to as the mental lexicon. English speakers know that the words joyful and peaceful
are part of English, and that giggleful and warful are not, or at least not yet. When a speaker
first coins a new word through derivation or compounding, listeners will often recognize
it as an innovation. At this point it is called a nonce formation. If other speakers pick it
up and use it, it can become an accepted part of the vocabulary or lexicon of the language.
```

**99 4 Morphology**

```
This process, by which a morphological formation comes to be recognized as an established
word in the language, is called lexicalization. A lexicalized word will be understood and
learned as a unit, rather than processed as a sequence of individual morphemes. It will have
a meaning of its own, which may or may not correspond to the sum of its parts. The word
joy-ful means ‘full of joy’ (as we would expect), but aw-ful no longer means ‘full of awe’
(though it once did), and cup-ful does not mean ‘full of cups.’

```
4.8 **Typology**

```
Languages are often classified according to their structural characteristics. The classification
of languages according to structural traits is a goal of linguistic typology , the study of
language types. Perhaps the oldest and still most commonly cited typologies are based on
morphological structure. Structures like that seen in the Engenni example at the beginning
of this chapter, with words that generally consist of just one
morpheme, are called isolating or analytic. Structures like
those in Mohawk are called polysynthetic , because words
tend to be made up of many ( poly- ) parts put together ( syn-
thetic ). This typological dimension, roughly the average num-
ber of morphemes per word, is called the degree of synthesis.
Languages like English and Japanese are often described as
```
### SIDEBAR 4.18

```
For more detailed descriptions of some
polysynthetic languages, see the following
Language Profiles: Nuuchahnulth (LP5),
South Conchucos Quechua (LP6), and
Seneca (LP13).
```

**100 Marianne Mithun**

```
“mildly synthetic,” that is, their words may consist of more than one morpheme, but they
do not generally show the elaborate morphological complexity of languages like Mohawk.
A second frequently cited typological feature is the degree of fusion. This characteristic
pertains to the clarity of divisions between morphemes in a word. Morphological struc-
tures with sharp boundaries between morphemes are described as agglutinating. The
English word understandable shows agglutinating structure: under-stand-able. Morphological
structures in which boundaries are not clear are described as fusional. The English word
men consists of the root man plus plural marking, but it is difficult to pull the two apart. A
language may have both agglutinating and fusional structures, like English, but languages
often show general tendencies one way or the other. Quechua, a language of Peru, Bolivia,
Ecuador, Colombia, and Argentina is often cited as an agglutinat-
ing language. The second line of the South Conchucos Quechua
example in (24) shows the individual morphemes in the word.
The top line shows how the word is pronounced (the colon indi-
cates vowel length). The individual shape of each morpheme
remains unchanged.

which shows the shape of each morpheme. Compare this to the
top line, which shows what happens when they are combined in
a word. (The colon represents vowel length.)

```
```
All of the morphemes listed in the second line are present,
but a series of historical sound changes have so obscured their
boundaries that only people steeped in the history of Iroquoian
languages can now decipher them.
```
4.9 **Morphology, Language, and Us**

```
Morphology is connected to both phonology and syntax, but is
distinct from each. Some of the patterns we see in phonology
have echoes in morphology: just as phonemes can take differ-
ent forms (allophones) in different contexts, so, too, morphemes
can take different forms (allomorphs) in different contexts. (For a discussion of how chil-
dren learn these forms and contexts, see Textbox 4.13.)
Both morphology and syntax consist of patterns of combining smaller pieces of language
to form larger ones: morphemes are combined into words, and words are combined into
sentences. But these two levels of structure are not the same. Speakers do not usually exploit
their knowledge of morphological patterns, particularly derivational ones, every time they
speak. They typically use this knowledge only on certain occasions to invent vocabulary,
when they feel the need for a new word.

### CHAPTER SUMMARY

```
This chapter has provided a glimpse into the kinds of structures inside words in different
languages. We began with the question of how to identify words in an unfamiliar
language. The elements that make up words are called morphemes. Morphemes can be
classified as bound or free; roots or affixes; prefixes, suffixes, infixes, or circumfixes; and
inflectional or derivational. Morphological structure can be discovered in an unfamiliar
language, and we can identify and describe alternating forms of morphemes, or
allomorphs. Languages can vary widely in their morphological structure: in how much
information is typically carried within a word (degree of synthesis) and how clear the
boundaries between elements are (degree of fusion). They can also differ in fascinating
ways in terms of the kinds of meanings they express. Such differences are not accidental;
they grow out of speakers’ use of language for everyday communication, and we can see
this reflected in how certain words have developed over time. This chapter has begun
to reveal the remarkable diversity of linguistic structures; information is packaged and
presented in very different ways across languages.
Morphemes are the building blocks of words, and words, in turn, are the building blocks
of sentences. How words are combined into sentences and the grammatical relationships
between them are the central concerns of the field of syntax. But first we’ll need to explore
in more depth the different kinds of words that one finds in language, and the behaviors
and characteristics that allow us to identify word classes.
```
### TEXTBOX 4.13 LEARNING MORPHOLOGY

```
Few parents explain affixes and allomorphy to their
children. You have probably never heard a parent say:
“To make a plural, dear, you must add the suffix - es
after sibilants, - s after other voiceless sounds, and - z
after other voiced sounds, unless the word requires a
special, lexically conditioned allomorph.” Language
acquisition occurs naturally, without explicit instruction.
In acquiring language, children often extend regular
patterns beyond where they are found in adult speech.
```
```
For example, children often say mouses and mans as
the plurals of mouse and man. It is clear that the child
has learned the regular rule of plural formation and
is applying it to all nouns. In time, the child will learn
the lexically conditioned forms of the plural and will
automatically substitute them for the forms created with
the regular plural affix for certain words. Chapter 14
discusses these processes in detail.
```
```
Comparing morphological patterns in different languages reveals certain features char-
acteristic of all human language. Languages are shaped by human cognitive abilities, such
as pattern recognition and extension, memory, and the ability to routinize recurring tasks.
It is in fact this deeper cognitive similarity that can lead to some of the most interesting
differences we see across languages, as speakers automate frequent patterns of expression.
Modern morphological distinctions are largely the result of what speakers have chosen to
express the most frequently over the course of development of their languages.

### CHAPTER PREVIEW

```
We have seen that words are constructed by the principled combination of morphemes, and
that this gives them internal structures that can be compared and contrasted across languages.
This chapter begins the study of how words are then elements in higher-level structures,
and how different types of words have different characteristics within such structures. It
will describe how words fall into distinct classes, such as noun, verb, adjective, adverb,
demonstrative, preposition, and quantifier. It will demonstrate that such classes are determined
by the morphological and syntactic behavior of words, not by their meanings. The chapter will
present the behavioral properties typical of the most common word classes cross-linguistically.
It will further demonstrate the world’s remarkable linguistic diversity in showing that not all
languages have the same set of word classes; as a result, linguists need to determine which
word classes are found in each language independently and which morphosyntactic properties
define each class in each language. The ability to understand and identify these behavioral
properties of words is a necessary step in conducting syntactic analysis and will thus be
important in later chapters.
```

**109 5 Word Classes**

### LIST OF AIMS

```
At the end of this chapter, students will be able to:
tstate why word classes need to be identified by morphosyntactic behavior, rather than by
meaning;
tidentify the most common morphosyntactic properties that characterize the most
common word classes in the languages of the world;
tstate the major ways in which languages differ with respect to word classes;
tidentify the major word classes in sentences in a data set;
tgiven a data set, present a clear argument that a set of words shares morphosyntactic
properties and so constitutes a distinct class.
```
5.1 **Words**

```
In this chapter we will move from the study of elements that compose the words of a lan-
guage to the words themselves. A word is an independent, phonologically coherent
linguistic unit, containing one or more morphemes, which can fill a particular slot
in a sentence. In a sentence such as The boy will eat the red apple , the word will can only
occur between boy and eat ; moving it can result in a different
sentence, Will the boy eat the red apple? , or in an ungrammatical
sentence: * The will boy eat the red apple (this text follows standard
linguistic practice in marking ungrammatical sentences with an
asterisk preceding the first word). The word will is one member
of a class of words, called auxiliary verbs , which can occupy
only one of two slots in a sentence, the slot directly preceding
the verb in a statement ( will eat ), or the slot at the beginning
of the sentence in a question ( Will the boy eat? ). In English, all
words are restricted syntactically in this way. Try moving the
word red in the sentence above. You will see that a grammatical
sentence occurs only if it is directly preceding a noun.
```
```
5.1.1 Identifying Word Classes
We can classify words based not only on their syntactic positioning but also on
their morphological behavior. Words such as red can be affixed by certain morphemes
( redd-er, redd-est ), but not others (*red-tion, *redd-ed, *red-ment ). The same morphological
behavior is shared by words such as sweet, hungry, fast, sad, tall , etc. These words are all
members of the same word class in English, a class of words that share morphological and
syntactic behavior. More specifically, these are members of the word class of adjectives.
Many of us were taught in school to identify word classes based on their meanings. For
example, I was taught that a noun designates “a person, place, thing, or concept,” while
verbs are “action words.” While these definitions are useful in making children aware of
word classes and helping them to develop their linguistic intuitions, they are highly prob-
lematic as analytical tools used in linguistic analysis. Take, for example, the word destruc-
tion. Does this designate an action, a thing, or an abstract concept? How about flip? Flip is
a noun in the sentence He performed a beautiful flip , but a verb in the sentence He flipped the

Syntax will be presented in detail in

formation of larger phrases.

```
pancakes. While it is clear that flip refers to an action in the latter
sentence, it is not clear that it refers to a “thing” or to a “con-
cept” in the former. The flip in the first example seems as much
an action as the second.
When we begin to deeply explore the lexicons of the world’s
languages, we encounter many such ambiguous cases. Luckily,
we are not restricted to semantic definitions when defining lex-
ical classes. Returning to our flip sentences, it is perfectly clear
that flip is a noun in the first sentence and a verb in the second. To see this, we need only
look at the syntactic positioning and morphological behavior. In the first sentence, flip
is the head of a noun phrase , where it combines with the adjective beautiful and the
indefinite article a. Only nouns may occur in this syntactic slot. Flip can also be made mor-
phologically plural in this phrase, e.g., beautiful flips ; again, this is behavior shared only by
nouns. In contrast to the noun flip , the verb flip inflects with the past-tense suffix - ed. It
could also take other verbal suffixes and occur in combination with an auxiliary verb, e.g.,
he is flipping the pancakes ; this behavior is shared only by verbs.
We have seen that while semantic definitions of word classes leave us wanting, morpho-
syntax provides clear and concrete evidence that allows us to differentiate nouns from
verbs in English. When we look at languages from all over the world, we find that the vast
majority of languages have clear morphosyntactic criteria by which distinct lexical classes
are defined (but see Textbox 5.1 for further discussion). Interestingly, languages differ
in the particular sets of lexical classes that they have. For example, there are many
languages without a lexical class of articles (e.g., English a and the ), while English lacks
lexical classes of classifiers and evidentials.
```
### TEXTBOX 5.1 DO ALL LANGUAGES DISTINGUISH NOUNS FROM VERBS?

```
There are a few languages where the evidence
for distinct word classes is not as clear. For
example, in some indigenous languages on the
northwest coast of North America it is difficult to
find morphosyntactic behavioral evidence that
differentiates noun roots from verb roots. These
```
```
languages have been central to debates about
whether the distinction between nouns and verbs is
universal, reflecting a core human conceptualization
of the world. For discussion of one such language,
see the Nuuchahnulth Language Profile, Section
LP5.2.3.
```
5.1.2 Cross-Linguistic Differences

```
Languages differ not only in their inventories of lexical classes but also in the size
of each lexical class. For example, while English has hundreds of adjectives, Jaruwara, an
Arawá language of native South America, has only fourteen (Dixon 2004: 75). This does
not mean that speakers of Jaruwara cannot express the concepts conveyed by adjectives
in English. It is just that they express most of these concepts with verbs or with possessed
nouns, rather than with lexical adjectives. Consider the following sentence in Jaruwara and
its English translation.

(1) Jaruwara (Dixon 2004: 192)
o-tati kone bite nafi sawa-wa kawahake
1 SG.POSS-head hair small all be.white-REDUP now
‘All the small hairs on my head are white now.’
The English sentence uses two lexical adjectives, small and white. The Jaruwara sentence
uses only one: bite ‘small.’ The concept of ‘white’ is conveyed with a lexical verb sawa ‘to
be white,’ which here has the final syllable repeated or reduplicated (marked by REDUP
in the morpheme gloss). This process, whereby all or part of a morpheme is repeated to
signal a certain meaning, applies to verbs in Jaruwara, but never to adjectives. The fact
that sawa-wa exhibits reduplication is one piece of evidence that
demonstrates that it is a verb.
The example above shows that in order to determine the
lexical class of a word in a language, we have to determine
which grammatical properties characterize each class.
Although no two languages use exactly the same set of criteria
to define their lexical classes, there are certain grammatical fea-
tures that frequently characterize lexical classes in the languages
of the world. What follows is a brief cross-linguistic overview of some of the grammatical
features that typically characterize common lexical classes. Remember that there is no lan-
guage that exhibits all the features discussed here, and there are many languages that use
criteria not in these lists.
```
```
5.2 Nouns
The term noun refers to a grammatically defined word class, whose members can
function as the heads of noun phrases. As will be discussed in the next chapter, noun
phrases are often linked grammatically to verbs and other elements, and often take on roles
such as subject or object. Nouns typically denote entities or concepts. Like verbs, adjectives,
and adverbs, nouns constitute an open word class in most lan-
guages of the world. That is, one can easily incorporate new members
into it through borrowing and other word-formation processes.
Open classes can be contrasted with closed word classes , or those
that are resistant to new members and whose members are often
small in number (e.g., Jaruwara adjectives or English articles; the lat-
ter has only two members, a(n) and the ).
It is common for nouns to inflect (i.e., have different morphological
forms) based on the grammatical category of number. The majority
of languages differentiate only singular number from plural , as in
English dog ~ dogs. However, some languages also have other number
categories, such as dual (exactly two), and paucal (a few).
In some languages, nouns are assigned grammatical genders ,
a term that refers to grammatical systems that classify nouns into
two or more types, which trigger distinct patterns of agreement on

```
articles, adjectives, verbs, or other word classes. Most people are aware of grammatical gen-
der in the Romance languages. For example, in French a male student is referred to as un
é tudiant and a female student as une é tudiante ; the e at the end of both the article and the
noun indicates feminine gender. While sexually male and female referents tend to be placed
in different categories in grammatical gender systems, many inanimate and other asexual
nouns are also classified in such systems. Many languages have more than two grammatical
genders and some languages have more extensive systems with many more noun classes.
In most languages, one cannot tell the grammatical gender of a noun from the form of the
noun alone (e.g., French légume ‘vegetable’ is masculine, while plume ‘feather’ is feminine).
It is common for nouns to inflect for case , the morphological marking of the syntactic
and (in some cases) semantic relationships that hold between the noun phrases and the
verb of a sentence (see Textbox 5.2). The paradigm in Table 5.1 illustrates eight distinct case
forms of Latin, five in the singular and three in the plural. (The phonological forms that
result from case inflections are referred to as declensions in traditional grammar.)
```

Dative (‘to’) fr ā tr ı̄ fr ā tribus
```
```
Genitive (‘of’) fr ā tris fr ā trum
```
### TEXTBOX 5.2 CASE

```
In many languages, the form of a noun (and sometimes
other elements within the noun phrase, such as
adjectives or demonstratives) will vary depending
on the syntactic and/or semantic relationship that
holds between the noun and another word in the
sentence (usually the verb). The Latin examples given
in Table 5.1 illustrate different case forms of the
```
```
Latin noun ‘brother.’ Nominative is the term for the
case used when the noun is the subject of a clause,
accusative is the case used when the noun is the object
of the clause, genitive is the case used when the noun
is a possessor (e.g., brother’s book ) or holds a similar
relationship with another noun, and locative is the case
used when the noun is a location ( on my brother ), etc.
```
```
Moving on to syntax, in many languages a noun must be present in a noun phrase in
order for modifiers to be used. For example, in English we cannot simply say his three red.
We must have a noun in order to use the modifiers, e.g., his three red bicycles. In most lan-
guages, only a noun can occur in this position, as the head of a noun phrase (the modifiers
are called dependents ). The noun and the modifiers together form a single syntactic unit
```

**113 5 Word Classes**

```
called a noun phrase (discussed in the next chapter). In most
languages the ordering of the noun with respect to its modifiers
is quite restricted. Thus, in English we cannot move the noun to
produce * his bicycle three red or * bicycle his three red. There is only
one “slot,” or position, in the noun phrase in which a noun may
occur.
This brief discussion has mentioned only three common
inflectional categories of nouns (number, gender, and case) and
only one syntactic feature (the ability to head a noun phrase). There are many other mor-
phosyntactic properties that can identify the class of noun in the world’s languages. When
a linguist is studying the grammar of a language, she or he must determine the particular
morphological and syntactic features that identify the class of nouns in that language; no
two languages will have exactly the same set of features as criteria.
```
```
5.3 Verbs
The term verb refers to a class of words that function as predicates, the structural
centers of clauses. Verbs typically denote actions, events, activities, or states. In most lan-
guages, the class of verbs is a large and open lexical class, with the ability to incorporate new
members. Verbs inflect for many different categories in the world’s languages. Most typically,
verbs inflect for tense (e.g., past, present, and future) and the
related category of aspect (e.g., ongoing versus completed), for
properties of their noun-phrase arguments (e.g., person, num-
ber, and gender), for negation , and for mood (e.g., declarative
and interrogative). Inflectional morphology of verbs in English
and Spanish is discussed in Textbox 5.3.
```
### SIDEBAR 5.6

```
Grammatical relations and semantic
case roles are further discussed
in Section 6.3. To further explore
case, see the Finnish Language
Profile, Section LP4.3, and the Tsez
Language Profile, Section LP7.3.1.
```
### SIDEBAR 5.7

```
For an example of a language with
a closed verb class, see the Bardi
Language Profile (LP8).
```
```
Table 5.2 on page 115 gives a partial paradigm of a verb in
Dolakha Newar, a Tibeto-Burman language spoken in Nepal.
Note that there are distinct forms for the present and future
tenses. The form of the verb also changes with the person and
number of the subject noun phrase. Hence wƗl-a-gi is used for ‘I
mix’; wƗl-a-gu is used for ‘we mix,’ etc. This type of inflection, in
which one word indexes semantic categories of another word, is
referred to as agreement (see Textbox 5.4). We can say that the
Dolakha verb “agrees” in person and number with the subject.
In Dolakha Newar, this is true of (almost) every verb and is true
only of verbs; agreement is a morphosyntactic feature which
uniquely identifies verbs in this language.
```
### SIDEBAR 5.8

```
Verb agreement is described for
several languages in the Language
Profiles: South Conchucos Quechua
(Section LP6.3), Tsez (Section LP7.3);
Bardi (Section LP8.2), Lowland
Chontal (Section LP9.2), Manambu
(Section LP10.3), and Seneca
(Section LP13.5).
```

**114 Carol Genetti**

### TEXTBOX 5.4 AGREEMENT

```
When the morphological form of the word varies
depending on categories in another word in the
same sentence, it is said to agree with that word
in that category. In English, demonstratives agree
in number with the accompanying noun, e.g., that
boy, those boys. In many languages, verbs agree in
person and number with the subject noun phrase.
```
```
For example, in French ‘I dance’ is je danse , but ‘we
dance’ is nous dansons , and ‘you (plural) dance’ is
vous dansez. Thus, the form of the verb changes
depending on the person and number of the subject.
In other words, the French verb agrees with the
subject in person and number, as do Spanish verbs
(as shown in Textbox 5.3).
```
### TEXTBOX 5.3 VERB INFLECTIONS IN ENGLISH AND SPANISH

```
English has only a small set of verbal inflections (i.e.,
inflectional morphemes that affix to verbs): a present
tense, which is used only if the subject is third-
person singular, a past tense, and two suffixes that
are traditionally referred to as the past and present
participles. The last two form compound tenses when
combined with an auxiliary:
The exception proves the rule.
They proved that the Higgs Boson exists.
It was proven to be correct.
They are proving her theory.
English verbs are complicated, as different classes
of verbs have undergone independent changes
over time. For many verbs the past tense and the
past participle have the same form (e.g., he cooked
```
```
dinner only once; breakfast was cooked daily , where
the former has the past tense and the latter the
past participle; compare to: he ate dinner only once;
breakfast was eaten daily ).
In other languages, such as Spanish, verbs have
many inflected forms. The paradigm below represents
less than a quarter of the inflected forms of a regular
Spanish verb.
Even though English and Spanish differ greatly in
their number of inflectional suffixes, in both languages
only verbs can take these suffixes.

Past tense -ed
Past participle -en

There are a number of syntactic properties that can characterize verbs in the world’s lan-
guages. In most languages, verbs occur in a fixed position in a neutral sentence. For
example, in English, the verb comes after the subject and before the object (if there is one),
as in the sentence John broke the lamp. In many languages, the verb comes at the end of the
sentence, as in Japanese:
```
```
(2) Japanese
```
```
boku ga tomodachi ni hana o ageta
1 SG NOM friend DAT flower ACC give.PST
‘I gave flowers to my friend.’
In other languages, the verb comes at the beginning of the sentence, as in Jacaltec, a Mayan
language spoken in Guatemala:
```
```
(3) Jacaltec (Craig 1977: 149)
```
```
xul naj pel ewi
come.PST CLF Peter yesterday
‘Peter came yesterday.’
In many languages, verbs occur in a fixed syntactic position with respect to auxiliary
verbs. Auxiliary verbs form a small and fairly closed subclass of verbs. They often occur
adjacent to the main verb (the verb that carries the more concrete
semantic information) but can also occur in other positions in the
clause. Auxiliary verbs can convey a range of meanings, such as
negation, necessity, obligation, and ability. Some auxiliaries, in com-
bination with the main verb, signal whether an event is ongoing,
completed, or habitual (these types of distinctions are referred to as
aspect). The presence of an auxiliary verb sometimes determines the
morphological form of a main verb. We can see this by comparing English should go, had
gone , and ought to go. A list of some auxiliary verbs in English is given in (4).

Each of the following English sentences has an adjective underlined. In which sentences is it modifying a noun
within a noun phrase and in which is it the complement of a copula? Check your answers in Sidebar 5.13 on
the next page.
a. The kids were really smart.
b. She gave him red roses on his birthday.
c. There was hot soup on the table when they came in.
d. He is never late for class.
```
```
In many languages, the form of the adjective varies depending on properties of the noun,
such as number, gender, or case. Thus, adjectives in such languages can be said to agree with
the noun. In Russian, adjectives agree with the noun in number, gender, and case, as the
paradigm in Table 5.3 shows.
Adjectives also often have forms for degree, such as comparative and superlative (e.g., big,
bigger , and biggest ).
```
5.4 **Adjectives**

```
The term adjective refers to a word class with distinct grammatical behaviors,
which functions to modify nouns. The class of adjectives can be either an open
class, easily incorporating new members, or a closed class with a finite number of
words, as in Jaruwara (discussed in Section 5.1 above).
In English and many other languages, the class of adjectives has two distinct syntactic
positions: adjectives can occur within a noun phrase where they modify a noun, as in the
sour apple. They can also occur as the complement to a copula ,
as in the apple is sour. This distributional pattern is found with all
English adjectives (see Stop and Reflect 5.2). Sometimes quantifi-
ers have this property ( all the books ~ that is all ), but they tend to
be considerably more restricted (e.g., * the books are several ).
```
### SIDEBAR 5.10

```
Copulas are further discussed in
Section 6.2.3, and in the Manange
Language Profile, Section LP3.2.2.
```

TABLE 5.3 Inflection of the Russian adjective novyj ‘new’ (Corbett 2004: 202)
```
```
Masculine Feminine Neuter Plural
Nominative novyj novaja novoe novye
```
```
Accusative * novuju novoe *
```
```
Genitive novogo novoj novogo novyx
```
```
Dative novomu novoj novomu novym
```
```
Instrumental novym novoj(u) novym novymi
```
```
Locative novom novoj novom novyx
* These forms depend additionally on animacy.
```
```
In many languages, words that express properties of nouns are not members of
a lexical class of adjectives but are actually verbs or nouns. For example, in Dolakha
Newar, all color terms are lexical verbs. Consider example (5).
```
```
(5) Dolakha Newar
ā mp he ŋ gar-a
mango red-3SG.PST
‘The mango became red/reddened.’
In (5), the word for ‘red’ takes verbal inflection, specifically the
suffix for third-person singular past. To produce the noun phrase
‘red mango,’ a different suffix is needed and the color term is
placed before the noun: h ẽ ga-u ā mp. Note that any verb can be
transformed into a noun modifier in this way. For example, com-
pare mi yer-a ‘the man came’ and ye-u mi ‘the man who came.’
It is clear that the word for ‘red’ in Dolakha Newar has the same
morphological and syntactic patterns as verbs do, and that it is
therefore, in fact, a verb.
```
5.5 **Adverbs**

```
Like adjectives, the word class of adverb can be either open or
closed. The term adverb is a cover term for words that are
not lexical nouns, verbs, or adjectives, but which still have
lexical (as opposed to grammatical) content (Payne 1997: 69). Semantically, adverbs
tend to be modifiers of verbs, clauses, or sentences or are used to indicate speaker attitude
( Incredibly, she forgot her keys again! ), stance ( He definitely won’t pay! ), or the type or source
of evidence ( Apparently they’ve already left ).
```

```

**118 Carol Genetti**

```
The extent to which adverbs, or subclasses of adverbs, demonstrate consistent morphosyn-
tactic behavior varies across languages. Often, they can be defined by their absence of gram-
matical properties: adverbs usually don’t inflect; they don’t occur within a noun phrase (unless
adjacent to an adjective); and they don’t occur with modifiers other than other adverbs. Some
adverbs demonstrate considerably more freedom of positioning than do nouns, verbs, or
adjectives. We can see this in the English sentences in (6).
```
```
(6) Slowly John opened the envelope.
John slowly opened the envelope.
John opened the envelope slowly.
```
```
No other word class in English has this degree of flexibility in positioning.
```
5.6 **Adpositions: Prepositions and Postpositions**

```
We now move from our discussion of lexical word classes (those that signal a vast array
of meanings) to a discussion of grammatical word classes (those that function gram-
matically and are more limited in the range of meanings they express). While lexical word
classes are open in most languages, grammatical word classes are generally closed ,
only admitting new members on rare occasion.
Most independent words that function grammatically do not inflect but have a single
morphological form; these are referred to as particles. There are many types of particles,
and particles may be found in a wide variety of grammatical word classes.
Prepositions and postpositions ( or adpositions ) are
(usually) particles that occur with a noun phrase and that
indicate the grammatical, spatial, temporal, or logical rela-
tionship of the noun phrase to another element of the clause.
English has prepositions; examples of prepositions in English are
on, of, with, by, under, like , and to.
Prepositions differ from postpositions in their linear ordering
with respect to the noun. Very simply, prepositions occur before the accompanying noun
phrase, while postpositions occur after it. In the following English examples, the preposi-
tions are underlined and the accompanying noun phrases are in square brackets:
```
**(7)** _I went to [the beach]_.
_The girl with [the umbrella] was still getting wet.
You’ll find the key under [the mat]_.
_He plays like [a professional athlete]._

```
Now consider the Japanese sentence below:
```
**(8)** Japanese (Shibatani 1990: 265)

```
taroo wa [tosyokan] ni itta ga , hon wa yomanakatta
Taroo TOP library to go.PST but book TOP read.NEG.PST
‘Taroo went to the library but did not read a book.’
```

range of different functions can

Profile, Section LP13.5.4.

### SIDEBAR 5.14

```
For more on deictic expressions ,
see Section 7.2.
```
### TEXTBOX 5.5 SINHALA DEMONSTRATIVE DISTINCTIONS

```
Sinhala, the national language of Sri Lanka, has four
levels of demonstratives: one is used if the referent is
close to the speaker, another if the referent is close to
the hearer, a third if the referent is visible but not close
to either one, and a fourth if the referent is not visible.
These forms are illustrated to the right. Note that the
last example is even used if the child is under the table
and pulling on the speaker’s leg.
```
```
meyaa lam ə yek ‘this is a child’ (in the vicinity of the
speaker)
oy ə lam ə yek ‘that is a child’ (in the vicinity of the
hearer)
ar ə lam ə yek ‘that is a child’ (not near either the
speaker or the hearer, but visible)
eeya lam ə yek ‘that is a child’ (not visible to the
speaker)
```
```
Note that the word ni ‘to’ follows the noun tosyokan ‘library’ and is thus a postposition.
Therefore, Japanese exhibits an ordering that is opposite to that used in English.
```
5.7 **Quantifiers and Numerals**

```
Quantifiers usually occur within the noun phrase where they indicate a quantity
of the object denoted by the noun. Languages differ as to how many quantifiers they
have, their structure, and their grammatical properties. Most languages allow only one
quantifier in a single noun phrase; the class of quantifiers can then be identified as the set
of words which can fill that single syntactic position.
In most languages, numerals form a word class distinct from quantifiers. In English, we
can note that while two quantifiers cannot co-occur in a single noun phrase (e.g., we can-
not say *many all boys ), a quantifier and a numeral may co-occur ( all three boys ). Numerals
can also take affixes to convert them from cardinal numbers (e.g., seven ) to ordinal numbers
( seven-th ). This grammatical behavior can distinguish numerals from other quantifiers in
the language.
```
```
5.8 Demonstratives
Demonstratives form a fairly closed set of words that occur within the noun
phrase and which have a deictic (“pointing”) function. Demonstratives can be used
to “point” to something in the immediate environment (e.g., this shirt is really ugly ), to
knowledge shared by the speaker and hearer ( That was outrageous last night! ), or to some-
thing that has just been said in the discourse ( That’s ridiculous! I never want to hear you say
that again ).
Languages differ in the size of the demonstrative class, as well
as in the distinctions which they draw. Perhaps all languages
minimally have a distinction between proximal demonstra-
tives (e.g., this ), which indicate things closer to the speaker, and
distal demonstratives (e.g., that ), which indicate things farther
from the speaker. Many languages make further distinctions; see
Textbox 5.5 for one such example.
```

**120 Carol Genetti**

### TEXTBOX 5.6 DEFINITE AND INDEFINITE ARTICLES IN ENGLISH

```
In English, the indefinite article is used when the
speaker judges that the hearer will not be able to
identify the referent of a noun phrase, e.g., in A man
came in , there is no assumption that the hearer should
know the man. Compare this with the sentence The
```
```
man came in. Here, the hearer is expected to know
which man is being referred to. This distinction
(referred to as definiteness) will be discussed again in
Chapter 9 on discourse.
```
5.9 **Articles**

```
Articles form a class of small grammatical particles that obligatorily occur
in some noun phrases. English distinguishes between the indefinite article a(n) and
the definite article the (see Textbox 5.6). Articles signal different meanings in different
languages.
In some languages, articles take different forms depending on the class of the head noun.
The French definite article, for example, has three forms: one used with singular masculine
nouns ( le ), one used with singular feminine nouns ( la ), and one used with plural nouns (les ).
```
**(9)** Nouns: [ _Cats_ ] _and_ [ _dogs_ ] _make good pets._
Verbs: _They_ [ _eat_ ] _and_ [ _drink_ ] _too much._
Adjectives: _My cat is_ [ _black_ ] _and_ [ _white_ ].
Adverbs: [ _Slowly_ ] _and_ [ _carefully_ ] _she filled the glass._
Noun phrases: _They brought_ [ _chocolate cookies_ ] _and_ [ _lemon cakes_ ].
Prepositional phrases: [ _Over the river_ ] _and_ [ _through the woods_ ].
Verb phrases: _We_ [ _ate chocolate_ ] _and_ [ _drank champagne_ ].
Clauses: [ _Robin ate chocolate_ ] _and_ [ _Chris drank champagne_ ].
Note that we cannot substitute the conjunction _but_ into all of the sentences above, only
those where verbs are involved.

5.11 **Pronouns**

```
Pronouns appear as the sole element of a noun phrase; they do not co-occur with
modifiers , thus they are distinct from nouns (see Textbox 5.7). Thus in English, the phrases
*the you, *big he , and *some us are highly ungrammatical. Pronouns are so called because
they may substitute for an entire noun phrase, e.g., The man with the yellow hat rescued
Curious George; he always does.
```
5.10 **Conjunctions**

```
Conjunctions are grammatical particles that conjoin two or more words, phrases,
or clauses at the same level of structure. Conjunctions can therefore be identified by
their position between two elements of the same syntactic type. For example, the conjunc-
tion and in English can be used to conjoin words, phrases, and clauses:
```

**121 5 Word Classes**

### TEXTBOX 5.7 NOMINALS

```
Pronouns and nouns are quite distinct in that nouns can
co-occur with modifiers while pronouns cannot. However,
they do share the syntactically powerful property of
```
```
serving as the head of a noun phrase. The term nominal
can be used as a cover term for nouns and pronouns (and
sometimes other things beyond the scope of this chapter).
```
```
Languages have distinct pronouns to refer to the speaker, the hearer, and others. These are
referred to as personal pronouns. Thus, we consistently find pronouns for first person
(refers to the speaker: I, we ), second person (refers to the addressee: you ), and third per-
son (refers neither to the speaker nor to the hearer: he, she, it, they ). Textbox 5.8 describes
another type of pronoun distinction as well. As these examples demonstrate, English distin-
guishes singular from plural pronouns in the first and the third person, but not in the sec-
ond person (English you can refer to one or more). English pronouns also distinguish case
to a limited extent. For example, we can contrast the first-person pronouns I, me , and my.
In some languages, personal pronouns distinguish many more cases than these; in others,
pronouns do not distinguish case at all.
```
### STOP AND REFLECT 5.3 ENGLISH Y’ALL

```
In some varieties of English, predominantly spoken in the American South, the pronoun y’all has developed
from you all. In what way does this innovation regularize the system of English personal pronouns?
```
### TEXTBOX 5.8 INCLUSIVE AND EXCLUSIVE PRONOUNS

```
It is not unusual for languages of the world to contrast
the categories of inclusive and exclusive in the first-
person plural pronouns. In English, the first-person
plural pronoun we can either include the hearer
(inclusive: you and I ) or exclude the hearer (exclusive:
She and I, but not you ). In other languages, distinct
pronouns can occur.
```
```
Dolakha Newar
thiji ‘we’ (inclusive: you and I and possibly others)
isi ‘we’ (exclusive: not you, but I and others)
Another example of an inclusive/exclusive distinction
can be found in the Bardi Language Profile, Textbox
LP8.5.
```
```
In addition to personal pronouns, there are also demonstrative pronouns. These are
simply demonstratives which occur in the syntactic position of pronouns, that is, as the
head of a noun phrase without modifiers, as in the sentence I hate that.
Interrogative pronouns are a subset of the interrogative words (or “question words”)
of a language that occur in the syntactic position of pronouns. Thus, who is an interrogative
pronoun in Who let the dog out? , while which is an interrogative word, but not an interroga-
tive pronoun, in Which class did you take?

### TEXTBOX 5.9 MANDARIN CHINESE NUMERAL CLASSIFIERS

```
In Mandarin Chinese, numeral classifiers are obligatory
between a numeral and a noun. Note how the classifier
```
```
varies with the animacy, size, shape, and function of the
noun:
```
```
tiáo : long and skinny things s ā n tiáo yú ‘three fish’
zh ā ng : flat things s ā n zh ā ng dìtú ‘three maps’
zh ɩ̄: small animals s ā n zh ɩ̄ g ŏ u ‘three dogs’

### CHAPTER SUMMARY

```
The world’s languages have a wide variety of word classes that reflect the diversity of
meanings and relations that people express in language. They are characterized by
regular grammatical properties that allow them to act as the building blocks for phrases,
sentences, and other utterances. Thus, one must examine these grammatical properties,
rather than meanings, to determine the classification of words. Not all languages have the
same set of word classes. Each language must be examined independently to determine
which word classes it has, and each class must be indentified based on the shared
morphological and syntactic properties of the words in the class. Table 5.4 lists each of the
word classes we have discussed, together with some of the morphological and syntactic
properties that each class may exhibit.
```
5.12 **Other Word Classes**

```
This chapter has focused primarily on word classes found in English and has outlined some
of the properties of word classes including noun, verb, adjective, adverb, demonstrative,
preposition, and quantifier. There are quite a few other word classes in the world’s lan-
guages that English does not have. For example, some languages have numeral classifi-
ers , words that obligatorily occur with a numeral but that vary with semantic properties of
the noun (see Textbox 5.9).
```
```
Other languages have evidentials , words that express the
source of a speaker’s knowledge for the content of the utterance
and their degree of certainty that the information is true. Other
languages have ideophones , words that convey a sensory per-
ception of a color, size, shape, etc. There are many other word
classes found in the world’s languages as well; an exhaustive list
is beyond the scope of the current chapter.

### TEXTBOX 5.10 DATA AND METHODS IN GRAMMATICAL ANALYSIS

```
Linguists use a number of different methods for
investigating grammar, (i.e. morphology, word
classes, and syntax). These include: introspection on
one’s native language, elicitation of grammaticality
judgments from native speakers, experiments, analysis
of recorded discourse, and quantitative methods
applied to large corpora of authentic language use.
Introspection on one’s own language and the
elicitation of grammaticality judgments from others
both require people to reflect on their native language,
compare examples, and determine whether or not
particular combinations are grammatical. These
methods can produce insightful and beneficial
results. On the other hand, thinking up examples in
the abstract removes the rich context that plays a
strong role in shaping linguistic choices. This means
that speakers might not think of all the potential
environments in which a given example might occur,
and so judge a form to be ungrammatical that might
actually be attested. Conversely, when speakers are
tasked with considering increasingly complicated
sentences over a period of time, they sometimes lose
track of their grammatical intuitions and can assess
sentences as grammatical that might never actually
occur. To address these problems, researchers have
developed controlled experimental methods for the
collection and analysis of grammaticality judgments,
which provide a stronger empirical basis for claims
regarding the nature of grammatical knowledge.
Another essential method in linguistics is the
recording, transcription, and analysis of naturally
occurring discourse. Since speech occurs in a particular
```
```
context to meet the communicative aims of the
speakers, analyzing discourse data allows one to study
how context shapes the lexical and structural choices
that speakers make as they converse. Native speakers
who examine such data can provide deeper context-
based insights and nuance to the analysis. Of course,
one would need to wade through a lot of discourse
data to assemble, for example, a complete paradigm of
an irregular verb in Italian, a task many native speakers
could accomplish in a manner of minutes. Different
methods are needed to answer different types of
questions.
Increasingly sophisticated computer technologies
have led to the development of powerful new
computational tools that linguists can apply to
very large data sets in order to identify statistically
significant patterns. This comparatively new field is
referred to as corpus linguistics. An example of an
insight from corpus linguistics related to word classes
in English discourse is that adjectives beginning with
the prefix a- (such as afraid, alive , or alone ) only rarely
modify nouns within a noun phrase (* the alive bird );
they function as complements of copulas or appear
elsewhere in the predicate more than 98 percent
of the time (Biber et al. 1999: 508). (Insights from
corpus linguistics for second language acquisition are
discussed in Section 15.2.2.)
All of these methods are useful and all have
advantages and disadvantages. They are
complementary, answer different types of questions,
and expand our theoretical perspectives in different
ways.

TABLE 5.4 Summary of common morphological and grammatical properties of word classes
```
```
Class Common morphological categories Common syntactic properties
Noun Number (singular, plural, etc.), gender
(masculine, feminine, neuter, etc.), case
(nominative, accusative, locative, etc.),
person of possessor (my, your, etc.)
```
```
May function as head of a noun phrase and so
occur with modifiers, such as adjectives ( black cat ),
quantifiers ( many years ), and demonstratives ( those
books )
```
```
Verb Tense (past, present, etc.), aspect
(completed, ongoing, etc.), person/
number/gender of arguments,
negation, mood (declarative,
interrogative, etc.)
```
```
Often restricted in position with respect to
arguments (e.g., sentence-initial in Jacaltec,
sentence-medial in English, sentence-final in
Japanese); may occur in combination with auxiliary
verbs
```
```
Adjective Comparative ( happier ); superlative
( happiest ); number, gender, or case of
modified noun
```
```
May be found within the noun phrase modifying
a noun ( happy people ) or as a complement to a
copula ( they are happy ); may co-occur ( big shiny
green leaves )
```
```
Adverb Absence of morphological inflection Some have freedom of positioning
```
```
Adposition Usually particles Precedes (preposition) or follows (postposition) a
noun phrase
```
```
Quantifiers Sometimes have common nominal
morphology, such as case-marking
```
```
Like adjectives, some can occur within a noun
phrase ( all people ) or as a copula complement ( that
is all ), but the latter position can be quite restricted
```
```
Numerals Ordinal versus cardinal Usually within a noun phrase; in some languages,
must co-occur with numeral classifiers
```
```
Demonstratives Distinguish at least proximal ( this ) from
distal ( that ); may inflect for various
properties of the noun, such as number
( this ~ these )
```
```
Occur within a noun phrase; may not co-occur
```
```
Articles Usually distinguish indefinite ( a ) from
definite ( the )
```
```
Obligatorily occur in many noun phrases
```
```
Conjunctions Usually particles, so do not vary in form Occur between syntactic elements of the same type
(nouns, noun phrases, etc.) which they conjoin
( apples or oranges )
```
```
Pronouns Distinguish person (1st, 2nd, 3rd), and
often distinguish number (singular,
plural), case (nominative, accusative,
etc.), and other morphological
categories of nouns
```
```
Occur as the only element in the noun phrase

### EXERCISES

**1.** Each of the following sentences has one word given in bold. State the word class of each bolded word and
    then give at least two pieces of evidence (morphological or syntactic) that justifies your analysis.
    Example: _I just_ **_oiled_** _the furniture._
    Word class: Verb
    Evidence: (i) The verb carries the past-tense suffix - _ed_. (ii) It follows the subject and directly precedes the
    object. (iii) It is preceded by the adverb _just_.
    **a.** _My nephew often_ **_drives_** _to Berkeley._
    **b.** _They are planning to make the journey in two long_ **_drives_**.
    **c.** _The grass is always_ **_greener_** _on the other side of the fence._
    **d.** _He walked onto the_ **_green_**.
    **e.** **_Usually_** _she is home by seven._
    **f.** _It is the_ **_usual_** _routine._
    Now do the same for the following quote, attributed to comedian Groucho Marx:
    _Time_ **_flies like_** _an arrow_ ; **_fruit flies like_** _a banana._
    **g.** **_flies_** in _Time flies like an arrow._
    **h.** **_like_** in _Time flies like an arrow._
    **i.** **_fruit flies_** in _fruit flies like a banana._
    **j.** **_like_** in _fruit flies like a banana._


**126 Carol Genetti**

**2.** Consider the following sentences:

```
a. John ran up a bill.
b. John ran up a hill.
Note that Example (c) is acceptable, while Example (d) is not:
c. John ran a bill up.
d. * John ran a hill up
Use what you know about word classes to explain this variation in behavior. Then come up with three
similar pairs of sentences that show the same patterns.
```
**3.** Below is an excerpt from the poem “Jabberwocky” by Lewis Carroll, an author who was noted for using
    made-up words in his work. Read the lines, with particular attention to the made-up words that are bolded
    and underlined, then answer the questions below.
       ’Twas brillig, and the slithy toves
          Did **gyre** and **gimble** in the **wabe** :
       All **mimsy** were the **borogoves** ,
          And the mome raths outgrabe.
       “Beware the Jabberwock, my son!
          The jaws that bite, the claws that catch!
       Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun
          The **frumious** Bandersnatch!”
       He took his **vorpal** sword in hand:
          Long time the manxome foe he sought –
       So rested he by the Tumtum tree,
          And stood awhile in thought.
       And, as in **uffish** thought he stood,
          The Jabberwock, with eyes of flame,
       Came whiffling through the **tulgey** wood,
        And burbled as it came!
       One, two! One, two! And through and through
          The vorpal blade went snicker-snack!
       He left it dead, and with its head
          He went **galumphing** back.
       “And, has thou slain the Jabberwock?
          Come to my arms, my beamish boy!
       O **frabjous** day! Callooh! Callay!”

### CHAPTER PREVIEW

```
The previous four chapters have shown how sounds are produced and patterned, how they
combine into morphemes, and how morphemes combine into words. We now continue up
the hierarchy to increasingly complex levels of structure by examining syntax: the combination
of words into phrases, clauses, and sentences, and the grammatical principles and relationships
that underlie these structures. Syntax is critical to communication as it allows us to talk about
events, describe situations, and attribute states, actions, or activities to particular individuals
or entities. This is done in part through grammatical relationships between verbs and noun
phrases. These relations are grammatically marked and are independent of the semantic
relationships between verbs and their arguments. The principles of syntactic organization also
allow us to express complex relationships between events or situations. This is done through
the combination of clauses into sentences through a variety of means.
Like the previous three units, this chapter emphasizes processes of analysis and
argumentation. Each language is unique in the range of grammatical phenomena that can
be used to identify and relate elements at every level of the syntax; each language needs to
be examined independently, with the syntactic structures justified by the language-particular
facts.

6.1 **Introduction**

```
Syntax refers to the set of grammatical structures that allow for the combina-
tion of words into phrases and sentences. As with other aspects of language, syntactic
structures are principled and systematic, with the potential for
detailed analysis and description. Words that occur in phrases
and sentences can be shown not only to have semantic, or
meaningful, relationships to each other but also to have intri-
cate grammatical relationships to each other. Syntax is impor-
tant because it provide speakers with a regular structure or
framework for conveying relationships between people, things,
or ideas and the states, events, or activities that they are involved
in. The regularity of this framework within a language allows
speakers to quickly produce and process the information. It also
allows for the marking of particular grammatical categories that
have arisen over time through repeated use by speakers. This
process of grammaticalization, as well as the process of syntactic
change, will be discussed more fully in Chapter 13. Textbox 6.1
introduces a longstanding theoretical debate in the field.
```

### TEXTBOX 6.1 FUNCTIONAL VERSUS FORMAL APPROACHES TO SYNTAX

```
This book approaches linguistics from a typological
and functional perspective. Within syntax, functional
approaches examine the relationship between
particular syntactic structures and how they are used
in discourse interaction, and especially seek to explore
how the functions have shaped the structures. That is,
they seek to explain syntactic structures based on how
they are used.
A very different perspective is found in approaches to
syntax grounded in formal theory. These approaches
seek to explain syntactic structures independently
```
```
of function, instead constructing formal models of
linguistic knowledge based on abstract categories,
structures, and principles. In some theories, such models
are posited to represent a single Universal Grammar
that is considered to be part of humankind’s genetic
endowment. Language-specific variation is brought
about through specific modifications of the model.
Radford et al. (2009) is an introductory textbook written
from this perspective. See also Section 14.10, for a
discussion of formal and functional approaches in the
study of how children acquire language.
```

**131 6 Syntax**

```
6.2 Constituent Structure
One of the central aspects of linguistic design is hierarchical structure : units contain
units that contain units. We have seen so far that there are units called words that contain
smaller units called morphemes, which are made up of smaller units called phonemes. We
will now move up from the word level to see that words com-
bine into phrases , that phrases combine into clauses , and
that clauses combine into sentences , leading us to progres-
sively more complex structures.
Consider the English sentence in (1):
```
```
(1) The kids arrived at the house.
Our intuitions tell us that the two words the and kids form a
single unit. By contrast, kids and arrived , to the exclusion of
the , do not. You can sense that there is a natural break between
kids and arrived , as indicated by the symbol | in (2). The starred
example, indicating a break between The and kids , does not
seem natural.
```
```
(2) a. The kids | arrived at the house
b. * The | kids arrived at the house
```
```
Observe that arrived at the house forms a unit, as it tells us
something about the kids, specifically what they did. We can
also note that at the house is optional; it can be left off and the
result would still be the grammatical sentence The kids arrived.
Of course, we would have to leave off the entire phrase. We
couldn’t say, for example, * the kids arrived at and remove only
the house. So at the house appears to be a single unit, separate
from arrived :
```
```
(2) c. arrived | at the house
d. * arrived at | the house
We are not finished, however, as the house is a smaller unit yet, with the definite article the
pertaining to house and not to at.
```
```
(2) e. at | the house
f. * at the | house
If we put each of these units within square brackets, we can represent the hierarchical
structure visually, as in (2g). The outermost set of brackets encloses the sentence as a whole:
```
```
(2) g. [[ The kids ][ arrived [ at [ the house ]]]]
The term constituent simply refers to a subpart of a higher unit. Our sentence con-
tains two major syntactic constituents: [ the kids ] and [ arrived at the house ]. The latter con-
tains two constituents, the verb arrived and the phrase [ at the house ]. This in turn contains
two constituents: the preposition at and the phrase [ the house ]. Finally, [ the house ] has two
```
### SIDEBAR 6.2

```
In several places throughout the
chapter, you will be directed to
apply what you learn to short data
sets. Answers are available on the
companion website, and indicated by
the website icon ( ).
Completing these data sets as you
work through the chapter is highly
recommended, as it will increase your
understanding of the unit and improve
your skills of linguistic analysis.
```
### SIDEBAR 6.3

```
Remember that when discussing
grammar, an asterisk (*) in front of a
phrase marks an example as “starred”;
i.e., it indicates that speakers find it to
be ill-formed or ungrammatical.
```

**132 Carol Genetti**

```
constituents: the definite article the and the noun house. Another way to represent the con-
stituent structure of this sentence would be to use a branching labeled tree diagram ,
where every node connecting two branches represents a constituent, labeled for its phrase
type and the lexical class of each word. Figure 6.1 presents the labeled tree diagram for
Example (2g). Abbreviations used in tree diagrams are given in Textbox 6.2.
```

### TEXTBOX 6.2

```
The following abbreviations are standard in labeled tree diagrams:
```
```
We have arrived at this analysis of the sentence’s constituent structure largely by
using speaker intuition. As scientists, however, it is important to move beyond the level of
intuition and to provide argumentation based on the structural facts of the language. We
will now provide such evidence for the three major types of phrasal constituents that
are found in English. These are the noun phrase (NP), the prepositional phrase (PP), and
the verb phrase (VP).
```
6.2.1 The Noun Phrase

```
A noun phrase is a grammatically coherent syntactic constituent containing a head noun
or a pronoun and optionally one or more modifiers. The noun or pronoun is the head
of the noun phrase, or the element that determines the type of syntactic constituent and
```
```
S clause or sentence
NP noun phrase
VP verb phrase
PP prepositional phrase
N noun
V verb
ADJ adjective
ADV adverb
```
```
DET determiner
ART article
QUANT quantifier
DEM demonstrative
PREP preposition
POST postposition
NUM numeral
```

**133 6 Syntax**

```
which is required in order for the modifiers, or dependents , to appear. Thus, in English
one cannot just say * the three big , leaving out the head noun. Typical dependents found in
the noun phrase include demonstratives, numerals, adjectives, articles, quantifiers, pos-
sessors, adpositional phrases (such as with a hammer ), and relative clauses (such as
who came late ). Textbox 6.3 gives some further examples of noun phrases in English, with
dependent elements underlined.
There are a number of ways to determine that noun phrases are grammatically coherent
units. In most languages the elements of the noun phrase must form a contiguous group
that behaves as a single unit. Here we will consider three distinct arguments that illustrate
the coherence of the noun phrase in English and hence its status as a syntactic constituent
in English. We will then look at a fourth argument for the coherence of the noun phrase in
some other languages.
First, a noun phrase can appear in any noun-phrase slot in a sentence, providing it fits
semantically. When noun phrases switch positions, they do so as complete wholes, as illus-
trated in (3):
```
```
(3) a. [ My best friend ] called [ the doctor ] for [ me ].
b. [ The doctor ] called [ my best friend ] for [ me ].
c. [ I ] called [ the doctor ] for [ my best friend ].
```
```
It is not possible to move only part of a noun phrase. We never
find, for example, * my the doctor called best friend for me. The fact that
the elements of a noun phrase form a cohesive group which acts
as a unit (all elements move together) demonstrates that the noun
phrase is a syntactic constituent. This argument is summarized in
Sidebar 6.4.
A second argument that a noun and its dependent modifiers form a single syntactic con-
stituent is that if one chooses to use a pronoun, it replaces not just the noun but all of the
dependents as well. Consider the sentence in (3a). We can replace the initial noun phrase
my best friend with the pronoun she , i.e., She called the doctor for me.
However, one can never say * my she or * my best she. This shows that
pronouns replace entire noun phrases, not just pieces of them. So
again we find evidence that the noun phrase works as a cohesive
unit. This argument is summarized in Sidebar 6.5.
```
### SIDEBAR 6.4

```
Argument 1: When noun phrases
are moved, they move as cohesive
units.
```
### SIDEBAR 6.5

```
Argument 2: When a pronoun is
used, it replaces an entire noun
phrase, not part of it.
```
### TEXTBOX 6.3 DEPENDENTS OF THE ENGLISH NOUN PHRASE

```
Possessors my dog; Susan’s play
Articles the truth; an insult
Demonstratives those words; that cookie
Numerals fifty representatives
Quantifiers some flowers; many nights
Adjectives blue dress; complex structures
```
```
Prepositional phrases the man with one black shoe
Relative clauses The woman who just arrived
Note : The English noun phrase can only have one
of the following elements: article, demonstrative,
possessor. Thus the phrases * the your book and
* a that flower are ungrammatical. The cover term
for these three categories is determiner.
```

**134 Carol Genetti**

```
A third argument for the syntactic unity of the noun phrase is that in most languages of
the world, the order of elements in the noun phrase is fixed. For example, in English we say
those three red books on the table. We cannot shift the order of modifiers to * three those red on
the table books , or *red three on the table books those , etc. The noun phrase thus has internal
structuring, a feature of cohesive units. Textbox 6.4 describes English noun-phrase ordering
using a syntactic template.
```
### TEXTBOX 6.4 SYNTACTIC TEMPLATES

```
One way to describe the ordering of elements in a
syntactic constituent is to use a template , which
represents the structure of a phrase schematically. It
lists all of the elements that could possibly occur in a
constituent in the order in which they occur. Optional
elements are placed in parentheses. The template for
the English noun phrase is as follows:
(DET) (QUANT) (NUM) (ADJ*) N (PP*) (REL)
```
```
The following abbreviations are standard: NP
noun phrase, DET determiner, QUANT quantifier,
ADJ adjective, N noun, PP prepositional phrase, REL
relative clause. An asterisk placed after the category
name indicates that you can have more than one of
that type of element in a single phrase. For example,
we can have more than one adjective, as in the big
black books.
```
```
It is important to note that the ordering discussed thus far is specific to English. Other lan-
guages have other set orders of noun-phrase elements. For example, in Mandarin Chinese,
noun-phrase elements have the order represented in the template in (4):
```
**(4)**  Noun-phrase template for Mandarin Chinese

```
(DEM) (NUM) (CLASSIFIER) (ADJ)* (NOMINALIZER) NOUN
```
```
A noun phrase of this structure is illustrated in (5a):
```
**(5) a.** _nà s_ ā _nd_ ũ _om_ ĕ _ilì-de h_ ũ _a_
DIST.DEM three CLF beautiful-NMLZ flower
‘those three beautiful flowers’
Alternate orders are ungrammatical, as illustrated in (5b):
**(5) b.** _*s_ ā _nd_ ũ _onà h_ ũ _am_ ĕ _ilì-de_
three CLF DIST.DEM flower beautiful-NMLZ

### SIDEBAR 6.6

```
Argument 3: The order of elements
within noun phrases is fixed, showing
that noun phrases have internal
structure, which indicates that they are
grammatical units.
```
### SIDEBAR 6.7

```
For a detailed look at noun phrases
in another language, see the Goemai
Language Profile (LP2).
```
```
The fact that the order of noun-phrase elements is fixed reveals
that noun phrases have an internal grammatical structure. Such
structuring is evidence that noun phrases are cohesive syntactic
units. This argument is summarized in Sidebar 6.6.
In some languages, there is other grammatical evidence for the
unity of the noun phrase. For example, in many languages ele-
ments of the noun phrase “agree” for number, gender, or other
categories. In Italian, the indefinite article agrees in gender with
the noun it modifies. In other words, the form of the indefinite
article depends upon whether the noun is masculine or femi-
nine. The examples in (6) illustrate this agreement.
```

**135 6 Syntax**

```
(6) a. un gatto ‘a male cat’
INDF.M male.cat
```
### STOP AND REFLECT 6.1 ENGLISH NOUN PHRASES

```
For (a) through (c) below, place brackets around each complete noun phrase and label the category of each
word. Answers are available on the website.
Hint : If you are not sure where the boundaries are, try replacing the noun phrase with a pronoun. You can
only do this with whole noun phrases, not with parts.
```
```
Model: [ My brother ] ate [ those fried green tomatoes ].
POSS N DEM ADJ ADJ N
Compare the example with pronouns: [ He ] ate [ them ]
a. Her friends brought six chocolate cakes to the party.
b. The whole group admired the presents on the table.
c. Her favorite present was from her father.
```
```
b. una gatta ‘a female cat’
INDF.F female.cat
```
### TEXTBOX 6.5 SYNTACTIC ARGUMENTATION

```
While it was possible for us to intuitively sense that
noun phrases are coherent syntactic units in English,
we have also been able to confirm our intuitions
with four arguments based on morphosyntactic
behavior:
t Argument 1 : Noun-phrase elements form a cohesive
unit that functions as a group.
t Argument 2 : When a pronoun is used, it replaces all
noun-phrase elements.
t Argument 3 : Noun-phrase elements have a fixed
internal order.
t Argument 4 : Agreement illustrates that noun-phrase
elements are grammatically related.
```
```
Since linguists take a scientific approach to language,
it is important not to rely solely on intuition – which
can be uncertain and variable – but to provide
concrete evidence for claims about linguistic structure.
Intuition can point in the right direction, but only with
argumentation based on linguistic evidence can we
reach our goal of a scientific analysis of language.
One of the skills students develop when studying
syntax is how to use arguments such as these
to prove that a particular combination of words
constitutes a syntactic constituent. Such arguments
(i.e., cohesiveness, replacement by a pronoun, fixed
ordering of elements, and agreement) are sometimes
called constituency tests.
```
```
This pattern of gender agreement applies only to elements
within the noun phrase, never to elements outside of it. This
behavior shows that the elements in the noun phrase are related
grammatically and hence that the noun phrase is a grammati-
cally cohesive unit. This argument is summarized in Sidebar 6.9,
and all arguments thus far are reviewed in Textbox 6.5.

6.2.2 The Adpositional Phrase

```
An adpositional phrase is a syntactic constituent consisting of an adposition (preposi-
tion or postposition), which is the head of the constituent, and a dependent noun phrase.
There are two types of adpositional phrases. In prepositional phrases the preposition
precedes the noun phrase, while in postpositional phrases the postposition follows the
noun phrase. Languages usually have either prepositional phrases or postpositional phrases,
but not both. The noun phrase that occurs in an adpositional phrase is called the object
of the adposition.
In most languages of the world, adpositions cannot occur without an accompanying
noun phrase. Thus, while we can easily say He came from the house in English, the sentence
* he came from , which lacks the dependent noun phrase, is ungrammatical. The same is true
in Mandarin Chinese. Example (7a) has a prepositional phrase, set off by square brackets:
```
**(7) a.** _W_ ŏ [ _g_ ē _nt_ ā] _ch_ ă _ojìa le_
1 SG with 3 SG argue PFV
‘I argued with him.’
The sentence is not grammatical if either the noun phrase or the preposition is absent, as
shown in (7b) and (7c):

**(7) b.** Noun phrase absent
* _W_ ŏ _g_ ē _nch_ ă _ojìa le_
1 SG with argue PFV

**(7) c.** Preposition absent
* _W_ ŏ _t_ ā _ch_ ā _ojìa le_
1 SG 3 SG.M argue PFV

```
The same is true of languages with postpositions. Consider Example (8), which illustrates
this phenomenon in Japanese. Here there is an instrumental postposition, which trans-
lates into English as ‘with’:
```
**(8) a.** _Taroo wa_ [ _pen de_ ] _e o kaita_
Taro TOP pen INST picture ACC draw.PST
‘Taro drew a picture with a pen.’
Again, we see that both the postposition and the noun phrase are required for a grammati-
cal sentence; it is not possible to omit either one:

**(8) b.** Noun-phrase absent
_*Taroo wa de e o kaita_
Taro TOP INST picture ACC draw.PST

**(8) c.** Postposition absent
_*Taroo wa pen e o kaita_
Taro TOP pen picture ACC draw.PST


**137 6 Syntax**

```
We have seen that adpositions require the presence of a noun
phrase to form a syntactically complete unit. Hence the adposi-
tion and the noun phrase together form a syntactic constituent.
A second argument for the adpositional phrase as a syntactic
constituent is that the ordering between the noun phrase and
the adposition is fixed. Thus, one can say in English Hit it with a
hammer but not * Hit it a hammer with. (At this point you might
be thinking about some seeming counterexamples to this claim,
like the English sentence Eat it up! However, up in this sentence is actually not a preposition
but a verb particle. For more on this, see Textbox 6.6.) Again, this is also true in Mandarin
Chinese; cóng táibČi means ‘from Taipei’; the reverse order which puts the preposition after
the noun phrase is ungrammatical: * táibČi cóng. Since elements of the adpositional phrase
occur in a fixed order, we see that it is a syntactic constituent.
```
### SIDEBAR 6.10

```
Obligatoriness (the requirement
that particular elements are present
to create a grammatical phrase)
is a constituency test that applies
to some (but not all) types of
constituents.
```
### TEXTBOX 6.6 ENGLISH PREPOSITION OR VERB PARTICLE?

```
In English syntax, we have to be careful to differentiate
prepositions , which head prepositional phrases, from
homophonous particles that occur in particle verbs.
Particle verbs are compounds that combine a verb with
a particle that historically developed from a preposition,
but no longer functions as one. Consider the following
English sentences:
a. Sonia walked out the door.
b. Sonia handed out the candy.
In example (a) there is a prepositional phrase out the
door , which contains a preposition out followed by a
noun phrase the door. The preposition indicates the
direction of the movement from an inside location
outward; it can be simply contrasted with in the
door which indicates movement in the opposite
direction. Now consider example (b). Native English
speakers will intuitively know that out the candy is not
a prepositional phrase in the same way that out the
```
```
door is in (a). Rather, out is part of the particle-verb
compound handed out. We can find syntactic proof for
this intuition in the fact that the (b) sentence can be
restated with the word out positioned after the noun
phrase, i.e., Sonia handed the candy out. The same is
not true of example (a). The sentence * Sonia walked the
door out is decidedly odd, and even if one can think of
a context where it would make sense (e.g., bringing
a door out by walking it), it is not the semantic
equivalent of the sentence in (a).
Also, notice that while substituting in for out in
example (a) simply indicates a change in direction,
substituting in for out in sentence (b) results in a
sentence with an entirely different meaning. This
is because hand in and hand out are each unique
compounds in the language with meanings that are
not simply derivative from the sum of their parts.
This is further evidence that hand out is a compound
and not a verb followed by a preposition.
```
```
Another argument for the adpositional phrase as a syntac-
tic unit is that in most languages the adposition and the noun
phrase must be contiguous; one cannot place other elements
between them. For example, in English we cannot say * He
arrived at suddenly the house. Even though adverbs like suddenly
can occur in a number of positions in the sentence, they cannot
be placed between the elements of a prepositional phrase. Again
this is true for Mandarin: one cannot say * cóng kè táib ĕ i , inserting kè ‘suddenly’ between the
preposition and the noun.
```
### SIDEBAR 6.11

```
Contiguity of elements – the
requirement that they be adjacent
with no intervening material – is
another useful test for constituency.
```

**138 Carol Genetti**

### TEXTBOX 6.7 TEMPLATE FOR THE PREPOSITIONAL PHRASE

```
The English prepositional phrase has a simple template:
PREP NP
Here PREP is the abbreviation for “preposition”
and NP for “noun phrase.” The abbreviation of
“prepositional phrase” is PP. Prepositional phrases
can have many structures, but that is because noun
```
```
phrases can have many structures; at the higher level
of the constituent represented here, the structure is
simple.
The template for a postpositional phrase (also
abbreviated PP) is simply:
NP POST
```
6.2.3 Other Types of Syntactic Constituents

```
Most languages of the world have noun phrases and adpositional phrases. However, there
are also other types of syntactic constituents that are less universal. Each language needs to
be examined independently in order to determine which syntactic constituents form the
building blocks of the syntax.
While noun phrases and adpositional phrases are probably the most common types of
phrases cross-linguistically, there are other types as well. For example, an adverb and an
adjective together can form an adjective phrase (e.g., English very well ), or in Mandarin, a
numeral and classifier can form a classifier phrase (e.g., s ā n d ŭ o ‘three (flowers)’).
English has clear evidence for a verb phrase , a syntactic constituent consisting of a
verb as the head of the phrase, and optional dependents including adverbs, prepositional
phrases, object noun phrases, and indirect objects in prepositional phrases. Examples of
English verb phrases are given in Textbox 6.8; a short exercise to check your understanding
appears in Stop and Reflect 6.2.
```

adjective.
```
```
We have presented three arguments for the syntactic unity of the adpositional phrase:
obligatoriness, ordering, and contiguity. Thus, we may conclude that the adposition and
noun phrase together form a small but tightly constructed syntactic constituent, the adpo-
sitional phrase. Textbox 6.7 gives templates for both prepositional and postpositional
phrases.

### SIDEBAR 6.12

```
See the Manange Language Profile
(LP3) for further discussion of copula
clauses, including a practice activity
with answers.
```
```
Verb phrases obligatorily contain a predicate (in English always a verb), the structural
center of the clause. A special type of verb is a copula , which denotes a relation between
two noun phrases or between a noun phrase and an adjective.
The copula in English is be. The noun phrase or adjective that
follows a copula is called the copula complement (sometimes
also the predicate nominal or predicate adjective ). In the
sentence Carlos is amazing, amazing is the copula complement
(predicate adjective). In the sentence Kobin is a top scholar , the
noun phrase a top scholar is the copula complement (predicate
nominal).
We will now explore two arguments for the status of the verb phrase as a syntactic con-
stituent in English. First, the order of elements within a verb phrase is relatively fixed. For
example, we cannot place elements other than an auxiliary or adverb before the verb, e.g.,
* She with the food drive helps and * Everyone would boxes of chocolates give are decidedly incor-
rect. Similarly, placing a prepositional phrase between the verb and a noun phrase results
in an ungrammatical sentence: * My kids baked for Halloween cookies. These types of tests
constitute clear evidence that the verb phrase is a unit that has internal structure.
A second argument that the English verb phrase forms a syntactic constituent is that it
can be replaced with the pro-verb do. Note that the entire verb phrase is replaced by do ,
not part of it, as the examples in (9) illustrate. (Although some of the starred sentences in
the examples below may be grammatical in other contexts, they are not possible utterances
in the exchanges given here.)
```
```
(9) a. Who lives in Sonoma?
My parents do.
*My parents do in Sonoma.
```
```
b. Does she drive to the mountains?
She does.
* She does to the mountains.
```

**140 Carol Genetti**

```
c. My kids baked cookies for Halloween.
They did?
*They did cookies?
d. Frida gave her dog to Frank.
She did?
*Did she her dog?
By replacing the verb phrases with pro-verbs, as in (9), we can see that the verb phrase in
English is treated as a single cohesive unit; thus, it is a syntactic constituent. The template
for the English verb phrase is given in Textbox 6.9.
```
### TEXTBOX 6.9 ENGLISH VERB PHRASE TEMPLATE

```
The structure of the English verb phrase can be
represented by the following template:
(ADV) V (ADV) (NP) (PP*) (ADV)
```
```
Note that adverbs can come in multiple positions.
```
```
However, not all languages have verb phrases. The grammatical arguments that illus-
trate the cohesiveness of the verb phrase in English do not automatically apply to other
languages. Every language must be analyzed independently to determine the set of phrasal
constituents and their particular grammatical features.
```
6.2.4 Recursive Structures in Syntax

```
An interesting syntactic design principle is recursion , the ability for a phrasal constituent
to embed another phrasal constituent of the same type within it. We can see this by exam-
ining the templates of the English noun phrase and the English prepositional phrase:
```
```
NP: (DET) (QUANT) (NUM) (ADJ*) N (PP*) (REL)
```
```
PP: PREP NP
```
```
Notice that the noun phrase can contain a prepositional phrase and that a prepositional
phrase obligatorily contains a noun phrase. This allows sentences such as (10), where a
prepositional phrase contains a noun phrase that contains a prepositional phrase that con-
tains a noun phrase that contains a prepositional phrase.
```
**(10)** _I will meet you at the top of the steps to the library.
at the top of the steps to the library_ PP
_the top of the steps to the library_ NP
_of the steps to the library_ PP
_the steps to the library_ NP
_to the library_ PP
_the library_ NP


**141 6 Syntax**

```
The structure can be explicitly represented by a labeled tree diagram. The elements of
each phrase are represented on a unique level of the tree, as in Figure 6.2.
We can see that each phrase type is recursively embedded into the other. In principle,
this recursion could go on infinitely; however, human cognitive constraints on memory –
as well as physical constraints on production – make excessively long recursive structures
impractical as mediums of communication. Nevertheless, the ability to embed one complex
element into another allows for great structural flexibility and expressive power in human
language.
```
6.3 **The Clause**

```
We will now move up from the phrase to the next higher level of syntactic organization:
the clause. A clause can be defined as a syntactic unit typically consisting of a verb (in
some languages within a verb phrase), its noun-phrase arguments, and optional adver-
bial elements (usually adverbs and adpositional phrases). As with other syntactic units,
clauses have internal organization. For example, in most languages the elements of the
clause occur in a relatively fixed order. Usually clauses occur as contiguous units; they
are not divided by other inserted elements that are not part of the clause. Clauses can
also have other restrictions; for example, typically only one tense can be specified per
clause.
We can see evidence for these facts in English. For example, the typical order for a verb
and its noun-phrase arguments in English is Subject-Verb-Object (SVO), as in (11). SVO is
```

only one of the dominant constituent orders in the world’s languages. For more on this
key typological distinction, see Textbox 6.10.
```
**(11)**

```
Note that other orderings result in ungrammatical sentences; e.g., * played my favorite song
the band is ungrammatical.
```
### TEXTBOX 6.10 CONSTITUENT ORDERING IN THE WORLD’S LANGUAGES

```
When we think about the relative ordering of subjects,
verbs, and objects, we realize that logically there are
only six possible orders: SVO, SOV, VSO, VOS, OSV,
and OVS. While all six orders have been attested in
the world’s languages, they occur with very different
frequencies: SVO and SOV are by far the most common
types. In one study of 1,377 languages (Dryer 2013),
565 had SOV as the dominant order of constituents,
while 488 were SVO. Considerably less common
were languages with a dominant order of VSO (95
languages). The other three orders were remarkably
rare: 25 were VOS, 11 were OVS, and 4 were OSV.
Other languages (189) have no dominant order. A
seminal article that first identified these and other
```
```
numerical patterns was Greenberg (1963). Greenberg
noted an important commonality between the three
most common orders. What is it?
In the Language Profiles, Manange and Manambu
are SOV languages, Goemai and Finnish are SVO,
while Nuuchanulth and Chontal place the verb
first and then have some flexibility in whether
the object precedes or follows the subject. Both
South Conchucos Quechua and Bardi have no
dominant order; for discussion, see especially the
Bardi Language Profile, Section LP8.2.7. As noted
there, it is not always easy to establish a dominant
order, especially in a language where noun-phrase
arguments are not regularly expressed.
```
```
We can see the contiguity of clausal elements if we put two clauses together with a con-
junction, as in (12).
```
**(12)** _Chris carried the popcorn and Robin carried the drinks._

```
The two clauses must occur in a strict linear order: first one then the other. We can’t scram-
ble their elements, as shown by the ungrammatical nature of *Chris the drinks carried the
popcorn and Robin carried or *Chris carried carried the popcorn and Robin the drinks.
Finally, the fact that clauses in English can have only one tense is illustrated by the inabil-
ity of the future auxiliary will to occur in the same clause as the third-person singular pres-
ent-tense morpheme - s. Thus, while both Camille will play her violin and Camille plays her violin
are acceptable, * Camille will plays is not. This restriction does not hold over separate clauses. So
we can say Camille plays today at 4 and she will play again tomorrow. There is a grammatical
uniformity within each clause (e.g., the entire clause is in future tense), which we can
describe using statements of grammatical regularity, or rules. The elements in a clause
are grammatically unified, demonstrating that the clause is an important unit in grammar.
We will now look in more detail at the grammatical relationships between elements of
the clause, beginning with verbs and their arguments.
```
6.3.1 Arguments and Transitivity

```
The term argument refers to a noun phrase, but rather than emphasizing its internal
constituent structure, the term emphasizes the grammatical status of the argument
```

**143 6 Syntax**

```
in relation to the verb. There are two types of arguments: core arguments and oblique
arguments. (See Textbox 6.11 on the meaning of the word argument .)
```
```
Oblique arguments do not have a grammatical relationship with the verb. They
may instead be grammatically linked to a preposition or a postposition, although they
don’t need to be. In many languages, oblique arguments have more freedom of positioning
than core arguments. Oblique arguments also convey information external to the strict ver-
bal semantics, such as the location of an event, its time, or the instrument used to carry out
an action. Try out the exercise given in Stop and Reflect 6.3 to check your understanding of
core versus oblique arguments.
```
### TEXTBOX 6.11 ARGUMENT

```
The word argument has both technical and non-
technical uses in linguistics and you will see both in this
chapter. The technical meaning is the one presented
here, a noun phrase of a particular grammatical status
```
```
in relation to a verb. Argument is also used in its non-
technical sense of advancing evidence in favor of
a conclusion. Both terms are used throughout this
chapter and throughout the book.
```
```
Each argument in the English sentences in (13) has been marked for its core or oblique
status:
```
```
(13) a. She ate her french fries with a fork.
core core oblique
b. My mother arrived at the airport this morning.
core oblique oblique
c. The ball hit the goal post.
core core
d. I      gave a dollar to my son for ice cream.
core core core oblique
```
```
Core arguments are those that have a grammatical relationship with the verb ;
this can be determined by their grammatical behavior, such as the ability to take certain
types of affixes, the ability to trigger affixation on the verb, and their ordering in the clause
with respect to other elements.
```
### STOP AND REFLECT 6.3 CORE AND OBLIQUE NOUN PHRASES

```
The noun phrases in each of the following examples are underlined. Determine whether each noun phrase is
core or oblique. Also note the transitivity of the verb. Answers can be found on the website.
Answers to Chapter 6 Stop and Reflect boxes
a. He left with his friends.
b. They will meet us at the restaurant.
c. Tomorrow I will drive from San Francisco to Los Angeles.
d. She gave the letter to her boyfriend.
```

**144 Carol Genetti**

```
A brief comparison of the examples in Table 6.1 shows that
clauses can differ in the number of core arguments. Some
verbs take only one core argument, other verbs take two, and
a smaller number of verbs take three. This property of verbs is
referred to as transitivity. Verbs that can take at most one
core argument are referred to as intransitive ; verbs that can
take at most two core arguments are referred to as transi-
tive ; and verbs that can take at most three core arguments are
referred to as ditransitive. Verbs of each type are illustrated in
Table 6.1, together with the number of core arguments and example sentences with the
core arguments underlined.
```
6.3.2 Grammatical Relations: Subjects

```
We have seen that verbs have a certain number of core arguments based on their transitivity.
Now we will examine how the various core arguments have different grammatical
relations with the verb. We will begin our discussion using English and the grammatical
relation of subject. Subjects are one type of core noun phrase. In the sentences in (14) –
taken from the Santa Barbara Corpus of Spoken American English – the subjects are in bold,
while objects are underlined.
```
**(14) a.** _I need new filters_. (SBC: 001)
**b.** _Do_ **you** _remember the date?_ (SBC: 008)
**c.** **_She_** _wants everything on her terms_. (SBC: 006)
**d.** **_Me and mom_** _always accused her of being lazy_. (SBC: 001)

### SIDEBAR 6.13

```
Sometimes a given verb can be used
either intransitively (e.g., she ate ) or
transitively ( she ate the mango ). Such
verbs are called ambitransitive.
Further discussion of this can be
found in the Manambu Language
Profile, Section LP10.2.4.

```
```
Ditransitive 3 ‘tell’ Mike told that story to my children.
```

**145 6 Syntax**

```
Note that the subjects in these sentences consistently precede the verb. This is the usual
position for subjects in English statements (although it is possible to change the order for
stylistic effect).
Another grammatical feature of English subjects is that they trigger the use of the
suffix - s on the verb. This suffix is used when the subject is both third-person and sin-
gular, as in (14c). Note that we can’t use the - s suffix when the subject is: first-person,
as in (14a); second-person, as in (b); or third-person plural, as in (d). Notice also that
the - s suffix is not triggered by her in (d), even though it is a third-person-singular core
argument. This is because her is the object of the verb accused , not the subject (hence
the use of her , the object form of the pronoun, as opposed to she , the subject form). The
verb agrees with third-person-singular subjects – rather than objects – in the present
tense, as in (c).
From this brief exercise, we have identified two grammatical properties that are shared
by English subjects:
```
```
i. English subjects occur before the verb in stylistically neutral statements.
ii. English subjects trigger third-person-singular agreement in the present tense.
There are a number of other grammatical features of subjects in English. Consider the fab-
ricated sentences in (15), both of which have the subject omitted in the first clause.
```
```
(15) a. Removing his sunglasses , Adam watched Sam.
b. Removing his sunglasses , Sam watched Adam.
```
```
In each case, it is necessarily the one who is watching (the subject of the second clause) who
also removes his sunglasses. When the subject of an initial clause is omitted in this fashion,
the omitted subject is necessarily coreferential with (that is, refers to the same entity as)
the subject of the following clause.
We can represent the grammatical relationships between the two subjects as in (16). A
null sign is used to indicate that the subject of the initial clause has been omitted.
```
**(16)** (^) [ØSUBJVERB OBJ]clause 1 [SUBJ VERB OBJ]clause 2
coreference
We have thus uncovered a third property of grammatical subjects in English:
**iii.** When combining clauses in a certain way, omitted subjects are necessarily coreferential
with the subject of the following clause.
**_Languages across the world differ in the grammatical properties that def ine
subjects_**. In Nepali, verb agreement indexes the person, number, and – for second and
third persons – the honorific status of the subject. The Nepali paradigm in (17) illustrates
these various verb forms in the present tense. Note that we find verb agreement with
subjects of both intransitive verbs (e.g., _sutnu_ ‘sleep’) and transitive verbs (e.g., _kh_ ā _nu_
‘eat’).

Case-markers with this distribution are said to mark
nominative (i.e., subject) case. Korean is unlike English in
this regard. Korean differs from both English and Nepali in
having case-marking, but not verb agreement. It is similar to
Nepali, however, in placing the verb at the end of the clause
and allowing flexibility in the word order of the subject and
the object.
This brief discussion illustrates that languages differ in the
grammatical properties that define the subject grammatical rela-
tion. While some languages may have a number of grammatical
properties that define this relation, others might have only one,
or even none. In the latter case, we would say that those languages lack the subject category.
```
6.3.3 Grammatical Relations: Objects

```
Transitive and ditransitive verbs have objects. Objects are also a type of core argument,
but objects have different grammatical properties from subjects. Consider again our
examples of transitive clauses in English; objects are underlined.
```
**(19) a.** _I need new filters._
**b.** _She wants everything._
**c.** _Me and mom always accused her._
**d.** _Adam removed his sunglasses._
**e.** _Sam watched Adam._

### SIDEBAR 6.14

```
The examples in (18) are taken from
recordings of parent–child discourse
as part of a larger study on Korean
language acquisition by Professor
Patricia Clancy, at the University
of California, Santa Barbara. The
utterances were produced by a child
named Wenceng, at age 2 years and
1 month.
```

**147 6 Syntax**

```
In English, objects directly follow the verb; these are called direct objects. We can
see that English grammatically distinguishes subjects from direct objects in part by their
ordering: in stylistically neutral declarative sentences, subjects precede the verb and objects
follow the verb. English is thus described as having SVO (Subject-Verb-Object) constituent
order.
English also distinguishes direct objects from indirect objects. By definition, indirect
objects occur only with ditransitive verbs. In English, indirect objects differ from direct
objects in that they can occur in two positions: in prepositional phrases following the prep-
ositions to or for and in so-called double-object constructions where they immediately
follow the verb. We can see these two possibilities in the related sentences in (20). Veronica ,
the indirect object, occurs following the preposition to in (20a), and in the first position of
the double-object construction in (20b).
```
```
(20) a. The Dean gave the prize to Veronica.
b. The Dean gave Veronica the prize.
```
```
In English, only indirect objects have the ability to occur in this pairing of positions.
```

In each of the ditransitive sentences below, identify the direct object and the indirect object. Then restate the

In many languages, case-marking is used to differentiate direct and indirect objects.
Case-markers that indicate direct objects are called accusative, while those that
indicate indirect objects are called dative. We can see case-marking differentiating
these two classes of objects in the Japanese sentences in (21). Note that direct objects occur
with the accusative case-marker regardless of whether they are objects of transitive (21a) or
ditransitive (21b) verbs.
```

‘Erika lent a book to Mika.’
```

**148 Carol Genetti**

```
Nez Perce, a Native American language spoken in eastern Oregon and western Idaho, also
has an accusative case-marker, as illustrated in (22).
```
**(22)** Nez Perce (Phinney 1934: 368)

```
Kaa wéetú núu-ne hi-nées-qic χ -ne
and not we-ACC 3.NOM-PL.OBJ-take.care-PST
‘And he didn’t take care of us.’
```
```
SIDEBAR 6.15
The symbol Ȥ indicates a voiceless
uvular fricative.
```
```
Example (22) also illustrates a verbal prefix nees -, which is used
when the direct object is plural (i.e., it “agrees in number” with
the object). Thus in Nez Perce, both case-marking and agree-
ment index the direct object grammatical relation. There are
many other grammatical properties related to categories
of object; each language needs to be examined independently
to determine which criteria (if any) distinguish between types
of objects.
```
```
6.3.4 Other Grammatical Relations
While subjects, objects, and indirect objects are familiar
from English and most European languages, these are not
the only core grammatical relations that are found in the
world’s languages. For example, it is quite common to have
grammatical properties that pertain only to the “subject” of
transitive verbs, but not to the “subject” of intransitive verbs.
We refer to this grammatical relation as ergative.
```
6.3.5 Grammatical Relations versus Semantic Case Roles

```
Up to this point, we have been looking solely at grammatical relations between arguments
and verbs, that is, the grammatical properties (such as agreement, case, order, etc.) that char-
acterize sets of core arguments. It is important to differentiate these grammatically defined
relationships from the semantic relationships between arguments and verbs. Consider the
sentences in (23).
```
**(23) a.** _Julie swims at the health club_.
**b.** _Julie feels dizzy after breakfast._
In (23a), Julie is acting intentionally, of her own volition; we say Julie is an **agent** in this
clause. In (23b) Julie is not a volitional actor, but someone experiencing a physical state;
we say here that Julie is an **experiencer**. In both cases, the noun phrase _Julie_ is the gram-
matical subject of the clause. It occurs before the verb and triggers the third-person-singular
agreement marker _-s_. So while the grammatical relationship between _Julie_ and the verb is
the same in both examples, the semantic relationship is different. **_Grammatical and
semantic relationships are independent of each other._**

### SIDEBAR 6.16

```
See the Manambu Language Profile,
Textbox LP10.7, for a discussion of
objects in Spanish (which is similar
to Manambu in this respect).
```
### SIDEBAR 6.17

```
Discussions of languages with
ergative grammatical patterns are
found in the following Language
Profiles: Manange (LP3), Tsez (LP7),
and Bardi (LP8).
```

**149 6 Syntax**

```
Now consider the two oblique arguments in (23a) and (b). You will see that while both the
health club and breakfast are oblique (i.e., neither is a core argument), they also differ seman-
tically; the health club indicates the location of an activity, while after breakfast is temporal,
specifying the time that the situation occurs.
The semantic relationships between verbs and arguments are referred to as
semantic case roles. The following list gives the most commonly found semantic case
roles in the world’s languages. To illustrate the independence of semantic case roles and
grammatical relations, the grammatical relation of each underlined NP will be given in
parentheses to the right of each example:
```
```
Case Role
```
```
t Agent : The volitional instigator of an activity or event.
Andrea carved the pumpkin. (subject)
The dog ate the cake. (subject)
This pumpkin was carved by Andrea. (oblique)
```
```
t Patient : An entity that undergoes a change of state as the result of an activity or event.
Andrea carved the pumpkin. (direct object)
The dog ate the cake. (direct object)
The pumpkins will be carved by Andrea. (subject)
```
```
t Theme : An entity undergoing motion or being located.
Shelly took the dog to the vet. (direct object)
Brian is at his mom’s house. (subject)
```
```
t Recipient : An entity that receives a theme.
He speaks Navajo to his children. (indirect object)
She got a letter from an old friend. (subject)
```
```
t Beneficiary : An entity who benefits from an action.
He substituted for John. (oblique)
He sang songs for the children. (indirect object)
They helped her when she was ill. (direct object)
He benefited from their kindness. (subject)
```
```
t Experiencer : An entity that experiences a physical or emotional state.
Clifford became delirious. (subject)
The heat overwhelmed her. (object)
```
```
t Location : A static location.
Brian slept at his mom’s house. (oblique)
Each packet contains one ounce of powder. (subject)
```

**150 Carol Genetti**

```
t Source : The beginning point of a motion trajectory.
She drove from San Francisco to Los Angeles. (oblique)
They left Kenya. (direct object)
Rotterdam will be next year’s starting point for the Tour de France. (subject)
```
```
t Goal : The endpoint of a motion trajectory.
She drove from San Francisco to Los Angeles. (oblique)
He hopes to reach Portland tomorrow. (direct object)
Seattle is their destination. (subject)
```
```
t Temporal : A location in time.
She comes home during the holidays. (oblique)
June is when the strawberries are at their best. (subject)
```
```
t Instrument : An entity used to perform an action.
She applied the last coat of paint with a roller. (oblique)
Dad used a small knife to cut open the fish. (direct object)
This type of key opens several locks. (subject)
```
```
These examples illustrate the independence of
semantic case roles and grammatical relations: each
semantic case role is shown in multiple grammat-
ical relations, and each grammatical relation is
shown with multiple case roles.
```
6.4 **Constructions**

```
Most of the examples cited so far in this chapter have illustrated affirmative, declarative,
active clauses, which are both the simplest and most prototypical clause types. However,
functions like signaling negation, asking questions, giving commands, and highlighting or
downplaying the importance of referents in discourse are also critical to human communi-
cation. For such tasks, languages have a variety of constructions , fixed grammatical
patterns associated with particular functions. Consider the five sentences in (24). Although
they all convey information about Olivia, a dog, and an event of finding, the sentences
have different forms and different functions.
```
**(24) a.**

```
b.
```
```
Olivia found the dog. Declarative, affirmative, active
Did Olivia find the dog? Interrogative, affirmative, active
c. Olivia didn’t find the dog. Declarative, negative, active
d. The dog was found. Declarative, affirmative, passive
e. Wasn’t the dog found? Interrogative, negative, passive
```
### SIDEBAR 6.18

```
The list of semantic case roles given here is not
exhaustive. Beginning students should become
familiar with these terms and be able to identify
these relations in sentences.
```
```
The sentence in (24b) illustrates a polar question (a question that one could answer with
a simple “yes” or “no” response). In English, polar questions require an auxiliary verb in
```

**151 6 Syntax**

```
the first position of the sentence. This is followed by the subject
noun phrase, and then the verb phrase. This is a construction,
with the fixed part of it being both the required auxiliary and
the strict ordering of the auxiliary, subject, and verb phrase; the
function is that of requesting an affirmative or negative response.
English negation, exemplified in (24c), also requires an aux-
iliary verb, which is followed by the negative morpheme not
(sometimes contracted into n’t ). In this case, the auxiliary fol-
lows the subject, as in the declarative clause. Note that this con-
struction requires the presence of a particular morpheme (the
negative) in a particular position.
The passive construction exemplified in (24d) requires a par-
ticular auxiliary – a form of the verb be – and a particular form
of the lexical verb (the past participle). In addition, the semantic
patient, which would typically be the direct object in an active construction, is the gram-
matical subject in the passive. These differences can be schematized as in Figure 6.3.
```

```
As shown in Figure 6.3, it is possible for a passive clause to specify the semantic agent
in a prepositional phrase as the object of the preposition by , e.g., The dog was found by
Olivia. This is optional, a feature denoted by the parentheses in the schema. The function
of the passive is to put noun phrases that denote prominent or important referents into the
subject position. For example, if people are discussing a particular lost dog and what hap-
pened to it, then keeping NPs referring to the dog in subject position allows for structural
continuity with the surrounding discourse. Passive constructions can also be used when
speakers want to de-emphasize an agent, or when the identity of an agent is unknown or
unimportant. Consider, for example, the ubiquitous passives of the structure [Celebrity
name] was spotted [e.g., at a local club, with their new romantic partner, etc.]. The identity
of the person spotting the celebrity is assumed to be unimportant to the reader compared
to the celebrity’s unexpected appearance in public.
It is important to note that there are cross-linguistic differences in the types of construc-
tions used for a given function. For example, Dolakha Newar signals negation by prefixing
a negative morpheme to the verb; auxiliaries are not required, as they are in English:
```

**152 Carol Genetti**

```
Polar questions are also constructed differently in Dolakha Newar than in English. The
construction adds a particle (glossed here as Q) to the end of the sentence:
```
**(26)** _chin khã la-ina_ ā
2 SG.ERG matter talk-2SG.FUT Q
‘Will you talk about this matter?’

```
Without the final question particle, the sentence in (26) would
be the affirmative counterpart, i.e., ‘you will talk about this
matter.’
Interestingly, the range of constructions that are attested in
the world’s languages for particular linguistic functions (such
as asking questions, signaling negation, or giving commands) is
usually quite limited. Study of such cross-linguistic variation is
the primary focus of linguistic typology and can tell us much
about how linguistic structures are used to meet speakers’ com-
municative needs.
```
6.5 **The Sentence**

```
A sentence is an integrated syntactic unit consisting of at least one clause (and some-
times adverbials that have scope over the sentence as a whole). The notion of integration
is important, because there is a difference between having two adjacent sentences that are
not integrated, as in (27a), and having two clauses integrated into a single sentence, as in
(27b) or (c).
```
```
(27) a. The sun came up. It shone in my eyes.
b. When the sun came up it shone in my eyes.
c. The sun came up and shone in my eyes.
```
```
In example (27a), there is nothing that connects the two sentences; each forms a com-
plete syntactic unit that could stand on its own as an independent utterance. By contrast,
in examples (27b) and (27c), the two clauses have been integrated into a single sentence.
In (27b), the first clause has been marked as subordinate by the use of an adverbial con-
junction, when. Note that this clause could not normally stand on its own; it is providing
the temporal frame for the following proposition.
In (27c) the two clauses have been coordinated by the conjunction and. The integration
of the two is evident from the omission of the subject in the second clause. In English, one
typically does not omit the subject in a single-clause sentence. Thus *Ø shone in my eyes ,
where Ø indicates the position of the omitted subject, is considered ungrammatical.
```
6.5.1 Complex Sentences

```
A complex sentence is a sentence with more than one clause. Both (27b) and (c) above
are complex sentences. Clauses can be combined either by coordinating two independent
clauses using a conjunction, thereby creating the larger unit, or by placing one clause inside
```

```
of another as a dependent (or subordinate) element. These two structural types can be rep-
resented schematically, as in Figure 6.4.
With coordination , two (or more) clauses are conjoined at the same level of structure.
In contrast, with subordination , a main or matrix clause contains a subordinate clause
within it as a dependent element. There are three types of subordinate clauses, as there are
three ways they can be positioned within a matrix clause. The three types are: adverbial
clauses, relative clauses, and complement clauses.
To begin our exploration, let’s consider some examples from Harry Potter and the Goblet of
Fire by J. K. Rowling; subordinate clauses are underlined.
```
```
(28) a. Hermione joined him a moment later and slipped him a butterbeer under his cloak.
b. Harry felt he ought to go, but his curiosity held him in the chair.
c. If Voldemort is really getting stronger again, my priority is to ensure your safety.
d. He sat with Hermione and Ron in the library as the sun set outside.
e. “Dumbledore, you know perfectly well that you did not make a mistake!”
f. She knew he’d passed information to the Death Eaters.
g. Harry watched the dragon nearest to them teeter dangerously on its back legs.
h. Professor Dumbledore was now looking down at Harry, who looked right back at him.
i. Those people whose names come out of the Goblet of Fire are bound to compete in the
tournament.
```
```
The nine sentences in (28) illustrate four distinct types of clause combining. Examples (a)
and (b) illustrate coordination; the clauses are combined using a simple conjunction ( and
in (a) and but in (b)). Examples (c) and (d) have adverbial clauses, which are marked by sub-
ordinating conjunctions ( if in (c) and as in (d)). Examples (e) through (g) illustrate comple-
ment clauses, where a clause functions as a noun-phrase argument of the matrix clause verb.
Examples (h) and (i) illustrate relative clauses, where a clause is placed within a noun phrase
and is a dependent of a head noun. We will now examine each structure in more detail.
```
```
6.5.2 Clause-Combining: Coordination versus Subordination
Coordination combines two clauses in linear sequence using a conjunction: typically and,
or , or but , or their equivalents in other languages. Clauses combined through coordination
form sentences that behave as single cohesive syntactic units. There are a number of argu-
ments that support this claim. For example, in English the subject of the second clause in a
```
```
Figure 6.4 Schematic representation of coordination and subordination
```
```

```
```
[clause] conjunction [clause] [matrix clause]
```
```
Subordination

```
```

```

**154 Carol Genetti**

```
coordinate structure can be omitted, as in (28a) above. This clause, with the absence of an
overt subject argument, would be ungrammatical if it occurred independently, i.e., * slipped
him a butterbeer under his cloak is not by itself a complete sentence; it is only grammatical
when combined with another clause via coordination.
A second argument that coordinated clauses act as a single cohesive unit is the fact that
the unit as a whole can be combined with other clauses. We see this in Example (29), where
two conjoined clauses (underlined) function as the complement of a matrix verb.
```
**(29)** _Harry watched Cedric pull a knife out of his pocket and cut Cho free._

6.5.3 Subordination: Adverbial Clauses

```
Adverbial clauses are linked to a matrix clause via a subordinating conjunction or
affix that specifies the semantic relationship between clauses. These conjunctions convey
meanings such as condition ( if ), cause ( because ), consequence ( so ), concession ( although ),
temporal sequence ( when, after ), temporal overlap ( while ), or purpose ( to, in order to ).
The subordinate status of adverbial clauses is evident from the fact that they cannot occur
independently; for example, as the sun set outside cannot stand alone as an independent
utterance. A tree diagram with an adverbial clause is given in Figure 6.5.
```
6.5.4 Subordination: Complement Clauses

```
Complement clauses function as noun phrase arguments of verbs. Consider again our
“Harry Potter” examples (28e) through (g), repeated here for convenience:
```
**e.** _“Dumbledore, you know perfectly well that you did not make a mistake!”_
**f.** _She knew he’d passed information to the Death Eaters._
**g.** _Harry watched the dragon nearest to them teeter dangerously on its back legs._

**155 6 Syntax**

```
In examples (e) and (f) the verb of the matrix clause is know and in (g) it is watch ; all three
are transitive verbs. Rather than having simple noun phrases as objects, however, these
examples have clauses as objects (the underlined portion in each example). These are
considered complement clauses as they “complement” or “complete” the verb by providing
one of its core arguments. These complements provide the object of the verb and are thus
object complements.
The labeled tree diagram of Example (28f) in Figure 6.6 schematically illustrates the rela-
tionship between the complement clause and the matrix verb. The object noun phrase that
directly follows the verb is itself a clause (indicated by S in the tree diagram): he’d passed
information to the Death Eaters.
```
```
6.5.5 Subordination: Relative Clauses
Relative clauses are similar to complement clauses in being related to noun phrases.
However, while complement clauses constitute an entire noun phrase, relative clauses
are embedded within noun phrases and function as dependent modifiers of
nouns.
Consider sentences (28h) and (i); the relative clauses are underlined.
```
```
h. Professor Dumbledore was now looking down at Harry, who looked right back at him.
i. Those people whose names come out of the Goblet of Fire are bound to compete in the tournament.
```
```
In English, relative clauses directly follow the nouns that they modify. The noun, relative
clause, and any other noun-phrase elements together form a single cohesive noun phrase.
We can see this by replacing the subject noun phrase of (i) with a pronoun. This produces
They are bound to compete in the tournament , with the pronoun replacing not just the demon-
strative and noun but also the relative clause. Keeping the relative clause in would produce
* They whose names come out of the Goblet of Fire , which is distinctly odd. This shows that the
relative clause is part of the same unit as the noun.
The structure of the noun phrase containing the relative clause in (i) is represented in a
labeled tree diagram in Figure 6.7.
```
```

**156 Carol Genetti**

```
Figures 6.6 and 6.7 illustrate the structural difference between complement clauses and
relative clauses respectively. With complement clauses, an embedded clause is an
entire noun phrase, while with relative clauses, an embedded clause is within a
noun phrase, following the noun that it modifies. Within the noun phrase, relative
clauses are dependent elements and nouns modified by relative clauses are called head
nouns. In describing the English relative clause, it is important to note that there is an
obligatory gap in the relative clause, which corresponds to the head noun. In the following
examples, the gap is represented by a null symbol:
The guy who Ø came late compare The guy came late
The guy I met Ø yesterday compare I met the guy
The guy I gave my keys to Ø compare I gave my keys to the guy
The guy I was working for Ø compare I worked for the guy
We can see this gapping as a grammatical adjustment for the integration of the relative
clause into the noun phrase. It helps to clarify the role of the head noun in the relative
clause.

Hints : If a conjunction separates the clauses, it is coordination. If there is a subordinating conjunc-
tion (e.g., if, when , etc.), it is an adverbial clause. If it directly follows a noun that it modifies, it is a
relative clause. If it directly follows a matrix verb, it is an object complement clause.

This discussion of complex sentences has focused on English. These same basic structures
for combining clauses are found in most of the world’s languages, along with some other
structures that are not found in English. Some of these are discussed in the Language Profiles;
see especially Manange (LP3), South Conchucos Quechua (LP6), and Manambu (LP0).

### CHAPTER SUMMARY

```
Words combine syntactically into phrases, which combine into clauses, which in turn
combine into sentences. At each level there are a variety of structural types:
```
```
tNoun phrases, adpositional phrases, and verb phrases are among the phrase types in the
world’s languages.
tClauses contain intransitive, transitive, and ditransitive verbs as their centers. These have
grammatical relationships with core arguments, including subjects, direct objects, and
indirect objects, as well as other categories. Oblique arguments are not grammatically
linked to verbs and generally convey information that supplements the verbal semantics.
tSentences combine clauses either by coordinating clauses at the same level of structure, or
by subordinating a clause, through adverbial, complement, or relative clause structures.
```
```
Just as with word-class categories, linguistic diversity is reflected in the variety of syntactic
categories that are relevant for any particular language. Each language must be examined
independently in order to determine the particular syntactic categories that are relevant for
that language. To do so, we need to examine patterns of distribution, compare sentences
that are minimally distinct, and provide arguments for the existence of structural categories.
Syntax allows us to go beyond the simple naming of things by words and to
communicate the multiplicity of situations, events, activities, actions, and complex
concepts in which we are engaged. It allows us to state, negate, question, command,
and describe. The networks of markings and grammatical relationships mean that words
are not simply thrown out randomly in the hopes that others will guess at how they are
related, but that they are closely tied to one another in precise and detailed ways. As such,
syntax is a central and critical component of linguistic communication.

### EXERCISES

**1.** Each of the following English sentences is followed by the label of a particular constituent. Identify that
    constituent in the sentence, then: (i) write out the entire constituent, (ii) state one structural characteristic
    that proves it is a constituent of that type, and based on the reading, (iii) provide an argument for
    constituency (i.e., name a constituency test) that further justifies your analysis.
    Example:
    _Marcus is watching football with his dad_. Prepositional phrase
    **i.** _with his dad_
    **ii.** It contains a preposition _with_ immediately followed by an NP _his dad._
    **iii.** Both the preposition and the noun phrase are required. The sentences * _Marcus is watching football his_
       _dad_ and * _Marcus is watching football with_ are ungrammatical. This criterion of obligatoriness shows
       that the preposition and the noun phrase are both required to occur, and that the prepositional phrase
       as a whole is a cohesive syntactic unit.

```
a. The coat on the back of the chair is still damp. Noun phrase
b. Ken put the ice-cream maker in the car. Verb phrase
c. I am going for a walk. Prepositional phrase
d. The family that moved in across the street keeps their car in the
driveway.
```
```
Subject NP
```
```
e. Olivia studied her world-history notes before the exam. Object NP
f. My dog never brings the stick to me. Indirect object NP
```
**2.** In each of the following examples, a set of words is underlined. Determine whether the underlined words
    constitute a _complete_ noun phrase in the sentence given; Provide at least one argument that justifies your
    analysis.
    Example:
    _John remembered to bring his mail to the office._
    **(i)** No, the underlined portion is not a noun phrase.
    **(ii)** Argument 1: you cannot use a pronoun to substitute for all of the underlined words, since _John brought_
       _it_ does not include _to the office_.
    **a.** _Brenda left her keys on the table in the front room._
    **b.** _My son is eating a sandwich in the courtyard._
    **c.** _He hopes to buy her a new car this weekend._
    **d.** _A group of prospective students came to campus._
    **e.** _His old headphones finally broke._
    **f.** _She took the book with the red cover._
    **g.** _She fixed the book with tape._
**3.** Draw labeled tree diagrams for each of the following sentences. If you are unsure about the constituent
    structure of an example, use the criteria and arguments discussed in the chapter to test whether the
    elements are part of the same constituent. Be sure to do the following:
tLabel the word class for every word in the sentence.
tGroup together constituents under a single node (e.g., VP, NP, PP).
tMake sure that all constituents are recognized.
tGive the English words at the bottom of the tree.

a. The team played four games at the youth center.
b. His new roommate bought a cake with frosting.
c. My daughter eats sushi with chopsticks.
d. I brought some coffee to the man at the table in the corner.
e. Those big dogs down the street always bark at the guy that delivers the mail.
```
**4.** The following sentence is syntactically ambiguous: there are two possible interpretations, each reflecting a
    different syntactic structure, although the string of words remains the same. Explain the two meanings and
    how they differ, and then draw labeled tree diagrams representing the two different possible structures.
       _I watched the birds in the garden._
**5.** Clausal syntax
    **i.** For each underlined noun phrase in the data below, determine the following:
       tWhether it is core or oblique
       tIts semantic case role
       tFor core arguments, its grammatical relation
    **ii.** For each of the **bolded verbs** , state whether it is intransitive, transitive, or ditransitive.
       **a.** _Robin_ **runs** _daily at sunrise._
       **b.** _Paul_ **_is_** **writing** _something on his computer._
       **c.** _My dog_ **gets excited** _when she_ **chases** _her ball in the park._
       **d.** _I_ **_will_** **give** _candy to kids on Halloween._
       **e.** _She_ **was taught** _English by her uncle._
**6.** For each of the following sentences, one clause is underlined. State whether it is coordinate or subordinate.
    If subordinate, state whether it is an adverbial, complement, or relative clause. Provide an argument that
    justifies your answer (in other words, how do you know you are right?).
    **a.** _She forgot that he hadn’t bought milk._
    **b.** _She noticed the empty milk carton that was in the recycling bin_.
    **c.** _He was annoyed when she arrived without the milk._
    **d.** _He stayed home while she went back out to the store._
    **e.** _She bought milk and stopped at the bakery for a chocolate cake._
    **f.** _Because she came in with the cake, he decided he was no longer annoyed._
**7.** Maninka is a Niger-Congo language spoken in West Africa. Tones are not represented in the following data
    set. (Data are taken from Bird and Shopen 1979.)
    **a.** _baba be na_ ‘Baba is coming.’
    **b.** _baba be ta_ ‘Baba is going.’
    **c.** _a be sigi_ ‘S/he is sitting.’
    **d.** _fanta be sunogo_ ‘Fanta is sleeping.’
    **e.** _baba be daga sigi_ ‘Baba is setting down the pot.’

ii. What meaning might the word be signal?
iii. What is the order of the noun phrases and the word be with respect to the verb in Maninka (in terms of
S (roughly subject), O (roughly object), and V (verb))?
```
**8.** The sentences below are from Indonesian (data provided by Bradley McDonnell). Analyze each sentence,
    providing the following three elements in your analysis:
    **i.** An interlinearized gloss for every example, e.g.:
       _Anak senang memakan ikan._
       child like eat fish
       ‘The child likes to eat fish.’
    **ii.** Brackets around all of the noun phrases in every example, e.g.:
       [ _Anak_ ] _senang memakan_ [ _ikan_ ].
       child like eat fish
       ‘The child likes to eat fish.’
    **iii.** A syntactic template for the Indonesian Noun Phrase based on what you’ve observed in this data set
       (see Textbox 6.4 for an example of a syntactic template).
    **iv.** Then, given what you know about the English Noun Phrase, briefly discuss in two–three sentences the
       similarities and differences between the Indonesian NP and the English NP.
    **a.** _Anjing itu melihat kucing._ ‘That dog saw (a) cat.’
    **b.** _Saya melihat tiga anjing besar itu._ ‘I saw those three big dogs.’
    **c.** _Mereka melihat dua anjing besar itu._ ‘They saw those two big dogs.’
    **d.** _Anjing itu melihat tiga kucing kecil itu._ ‘That dog saw those three small cats.’
    **e.** _Saya melihat tiga kucing besar itu._ ‘I saw those three big cats.’
    **f.** _Dia melihat dua anjing besar itu_. ‘He saw those two big dogs.’
    **g.** _Kucing itu melihat anjing_. ‘That cat saw (a) dog.’
    **h.** _Saya melihat dua anjing besar itu_. ‘I saw those two big dogs.’
**9.** Examples (a) through (g) below are from Korean (data provided by Heather Simpson). Analyze each of the
    following sentences from Korean, providing:
    **i.** An interlinearized gloss with free translation for every example;
    **ii.** brackets around all of the noun phrases for every example; and
    **iii.** a syntactic template for the Korean Noun Phrase (see Textbox 6.4).
    Grammatical note 1: _ma_ ɾ _i_ is a **classifier** , a word class that English does not have, but which is close to
       something like _batch_ in _five batches of cookies_. In the examples here it is part of the noun phrase. You
       should use the abbreviation CLS for this word class and for the word _ma_ ɾ _i_ in the interlinearized gloss.
    Grammatical note 2: When words in the English free translation are given in parentheses, it means that
       it is necessary to use the word in the English sentence to convey the intended meaning, but it is not
       grammatically necessary (or sometimes even grammatically possible) in the language of study. Korean
       is like many languages in not requiring that subject arguments be expressed by noun phrases.

    **ii.** What is the order of the core arguments with regard to the verb in the unmarked Hixkaryana clause?
       Characterize in terms of S (subject), O (object), and V (verb).
**11.** Nepali is an Indo-Aryan language and the national language of Nepal. The goal of this problem is to
    determine the basic principles underlying the grammatical marking of Nepali noun phrases. The answer
    you turn in should be a coherent analysis of Nepali syntax, based upon the data below. Questions (i)
    through (vii) are designed to help you work through the data and produce an analysis. Question (viii) tells
    you what to include in your prose write-up to complete the problem.
    Consider the following sentences (in Nepali orthography, ā indicates a low central vowel and _a_ indicates
       IPA [ə]):

```
a. mero ā male m ā nchel ā i pasalm ā heryo. ‘My mother saw the man at the store.’
b. mero ā m ā le m ā nchel ā i heryo. ‘My mother saw the man.’
c. usko ā m ā le m ā nchel ā i pasalm ā heryo. ‘His mother saw the man at the store.’
d. mero ā m ā le mero d ā il ā i pasalm ā heryo. ‘My mother saw my brother at the store.’
e. mero ā m ā le mero d ā il ā i pasalm ā bhe t.y o. ‘My mother met my brother at the store.’
f. mero d ā ile mero ā m ā l ā i pasalm ā bhe t.y o. ‘My brother met my mother at the store.’
g. mero ā m ā nep ā lm ā ā yo. ‘My mother came to Nepal.’
h. ma nep ā lm ā^ āẽ. ‘I came to Nepal.’
i. usko d ā i pasalm ā ā yo. ‘His brother came to the store.’
j. usko pasal r ā mro cha. ‘His store is good.’
k. mero ā m ā r ā mro cha. ‘My mother is good/beautiful.’
l. mero ā m ā cal ā kh cha. ‘My mother is clever.’
m. mero cal ā kh ā m ā pasalm ā ā yo. ‘My clever mother came to the store.’
i. Identify the Nepali word for each English meaning by comparing example sentences that differ
minimally (as with morphological analysis). If there is more than one form, write them all:
‘my’ ‘mother’
‘his’ ‘man’
‘store’ ‘saw’
‘met’ ‘good/beautiful’
‘brother’ ‘came’
‘clever’
ii. Constituent analysis. Identify the word class of each word. Break each sentence into phrasal
constituents. You may want to separate these using square brackets.
iii. Determine whether the verbs for ‘saw,’ ‘met,’ and ‘come’ are transitive or intransitive. You can do this
by counting the number of core arguments in each clause (assume pasalmƗ is oblique).
iv. The verb cha is a copula, like English be. What type of copula complement is found in Examples j
through l (adjectival or nominal)?
```

**163 6 Syntax**

```
v. Morphological analysis. Compare words with more than one form.
Determine the position of morpheme boundaries. List all affixes.
vi. Determine the grammatical function of each affix. Under what
morphosyntactic conditions does each affix appear? Give a brief statement
of the meaning or grammatical function of each affix. Hint: Consider the
transitivity of the verbs and the grammatical relations of the arguments.
vii. Based on these data, what is the basic constituent order of the Nepali
transitive clause? Use the terms S (subject), O (object), and V (verb) to
characterize the order. (E.g., the English sentence The dog bit the cat is an
SVO sentence: the subject precedes the verb, which precedes the object.)
viii. Now type up the problem, using academic English prose. Be sure that your write-up:
tstates the overall goals of the problem;
tlists each word, with meanings, broken into morphemes where necessary;
tclearly states the grammatical function of grammatical affixes and provides evidence for this by citing the
relevant examples;
tclearly states the constituent order of Nepali;
tprovides a complete syntactic analysis of examples (a), (h), (k), and (m), noting the following:
```
- the noun or adpositional phrase boundaries, marked with square brackets and labeled
- the transitivity of the verb
- the class of each word
- the core and oblique arguments of each example.
    Here are some examples of a complete syntactic analysis of some English sentences; your analysis of
    Nepali should take this form, but using Nepali words instead of English.

# 7 Semantics

_How Language Makes Sense_

### CHAPTER PREVIEW

```
Semantics is the study of meaning in language , in particular of those meanings that are
conventionally encoded by linguistic expressions. While phonology, morphology, and syntax
focus on the formal structure of linguistic expressions, semantics considers their content: the
ways they make sense. Utterance interpretation is often an open-ended and idiosyncratic
process; a good semantic analysis can offer precise insights as to where the process begins and
how to proceed. This chapter introduces students to some basic ways of thinking about the
meanings of words and phrases both in terms of their objective (truth conditional) content
and in terms of their subjective effects on the imagination of a language user. Important
topics include sense and reference, propositional content, entailments and presuppositions,
prototypes and category structure, lexical semantic relations, construal, and polysemy.
```
### LIST OF AIMS

```
At the end of this chapter, students will be able to:
tdistinguish the encoded (semantic) meanings of expressions from their inferred
(pragmatic) meanings;
tidentify entailments and presuppositions associated with lexemes;
```
### KEY TERMS

tSense and reference
tSigns: icon, index, symbol
tConnotations and construal
tPropositions: entailments,

```
tPrototype and category structure
tSemantic relations: synonymy,
hyponymy, antonymy
tFrames and profiling
tPolysemy
tMetaphor and metonymy
```

**165 7 Semantics**

```
tidentify semantic relations between different lexemes: synonymy, hyponymy, and
antonymy;
tdistinguish vagueness and polysemy, and identify metaphoric and metonymic relations
between the senses of a lexeme;
tdistinguish the profile of a linguistic sense from the larger conceptual frame within which
it is construed.
```
7.1 **The Meaning of “Meaning”**

```
All human languages allow speakers to talk about the world as it is and as it might be, and
to say things which are either true or false, depending on the situation, and with which
other speakers can agree or disagree. Languages are useful in these ways because they are
meaningful; in other words, they are useful because linguistic
expressions have stable meanings that combine in regular ways
to express an unbounded number of imaginable thoughts (see
Textbox 7.1).
Meaning is in many ways the most obvious part of language.
Ordinarily, language users are entirely unaware of the intricate
rules of phonology, morphology, and syntax that shape their use
of language. There is simply too much going on, and at too many
levels of organization, for even the most meticulous reader or
writer to pay attention to it all at once. In any case, people usu-
ally care much more about what is expressed in language than
they do about the formal structure of a text or discourse. A text itself is but a means to an
end, a vehicle people use to send and receive meaningful messages.
But meaning also seems mysterious and insubstantial, difficult to pin down or define. In
fact, the English noun meaning and the verb mean from which it derives have several dis-
tinct meanings themselves. In some cases, the verb mean doesn’t pertain to word, phrase,
or sentence meanings at all. In (1), for example, the verb mean indicates a relation between
a fact and the conclusions one might draw from that fact; and in (2) the verb denotes the
relation between an actor and an intended action.
```

chapter in the Glossary (at the back of

```
### TEXTBOX 7.1 LINGUISTIC EXPRESSIONS AND SEMANTIC CONTENT

```
Whatever else meaning might be, it is something that
attaches to linguistic expressions – both to individual
words and to morphemes, like cat and plural - s , and
to complex phrases like cool as a cucumber and how do
you do. The word expression is used broadly for any
linguistic form at any level of complexity that has some
kind of meaning. An expression is any bit of language,
however small or abstract, that can be used to express
something. In this chapter, we will call the thing that
```
```
gets expressed by an expression its semantic content ,
or simply, its sense. Like the morphosyntactic forms
to which they attach, senses can be very small and
abstract (as in inflectional and derivational morphemes,
like the English plural - s or agentive - er suffixes), or
very complex and vivid (e.g., in content words like
cat, carouse, cajole , and caboose , and in multi-word
expressions like shoot the breeze, hit the hay, go for a
ride , or take the wheel ).
```

**166 Michael Israel**

( **1)** _The fact that it’s raining means you’ll get wet if you go outside._

( **2)** _Something is going on around here and I mean to find out what._

```
This chapter is concerned specifically with the kinds of meanings that get associated with
linguistic expressions. In (3), for example, the verb mean refers to the relation between a
linguistic form and the information it normally conveys:
```
**(3)** _The French expression_ laissez les bon temps rouler _means ‘have a ball!’_

```
The meanings in (1) to (3) are senses: stable properties of words and phrases, the ideas
they conventionally express. Contrast this with the example in (4):
```
**(4)** _She didn’t really mean what she said._

```
We all regularly experience cases where a person says one thing and means another. This
sort of meaning, utterance meaning , is not just a matter of linguistic conventions, but
crucially depends on the communicative intentions of a speaker (or writer) and how they
are interpreted by a hearer (or reader). This is a matter of pragmatics , how the context of
an utterance impacts its use and interpretation, which is the subject of the next chapter.
Semantics , on the other hand, considers meanings to be stable properties of linguistic
expressions: lexical semantics studies the senses of individual lexemes and morphemes;
compositional semantics considers how the sense of a complex expression is related
to the senses of its individual parts. Semantics studies the meanings directly encoded
by linguistic forms, while pragmatics studies the ways people draw on context to
accomplish and interpret communicative goals.
When language gets used, even the most mundane utterances tend to express more than
just what is literally said: for example, if one morning I say to a friend “I slept badly, and I
didn’t have any breakfast,” she will likely infer that I slept badly last night , and I have not
had breakfast today. The extra meaning seems obvious and is clearly part of what I would
communicate with such an utterance. But it is not part of that sentence’s coded content ;
it is inferred from the context. Similarly, if my friend responds by saying, “Do you want to
go get something to eat?” I would likely take it as a suggestion that we go eat something,
though the sentence is literally just a question about what I want.
Normally, of course, the pragmatic meaning of an utterance is closely related to its semantic
content: speakers usually try to say more or less what they mean, to line up the conventional
content of their utterances with the thoughts they want to communicate. Ultimately, that is
what semantic conventions are for. There are other ways one can get an idea across, but seman-
tic conventions make it much easier: they allow people to share information in ways that others
will be sure to understand. A convention , in general, is just a customary way of doing some-
thing in a community, an arbitrary behavior that people adhere to because they expect others
to do the same. Semantic conventions, then, are customary ways of interpreting linguistic forms
that speakers rely on because they expect others in their community to rely on them as well.
Because the semantic content of an expression is conventional, it is always at least partly
arbitrary. In principle, any sense that is conventionally expressed one way could just as eas-
ily be expressed some other way. If it’s a convention, then it could have been different. This,
of course, is why languages can differ as much as they do: what in English is called a tree is in
```

**167 7 Semantics**

```
French called arbre , in German Baum , and in Swahili mti. But the arbitrariness of language is
also the reason that words can express concepts at all, rather than just referring to individual
items and situations. The word tree does not on its own refer to any particular tree or group
of trees; rather, it expresses a general idea and so can be used to trigger thoughts about any
sort of tree or trees one could ever imagine. Because the link between form and sense is arbi-
trary, it is trivial for any kind of idea – no matter how abstract or fantastic – to be encoded as
a sense; the only real constraints are that an encoded concept must be somehow within the
realm of human imagination and something that a speaker might want to express. In fact,
the arbitrary nature of the linguistic sign is precisely what makes it so boundlessly powerful.

The following short exchange was recorded as part of the Santa Barbara Corpus of Spoken American English
(SBC: 034). It took place at 10:30, as a wife came home from work:
Husband : How was work?
Wife : I’m so tired.
What is the literal meaning of the wife’s response? What is the intended meaning? How do you think the
husband might have interpreted this response?

7.2 Kinds of Signs: Icon, Index, Symbol
Linguistic signs typically consist of two parts: a meaningful form, the signifier , and its asso-
ciated interpretation, the signified ; the sign is the relation between these. The philosopher
Charles Sanders Peirce famously distinguished three basic kinds of signs, based on the dif-
ferent ways a signifier can relate to its signified: in an icon the signifier somehow resembles
its signified; in an index the two are somehow physically or causally connected, so that the
presence of the signifier effectively points to, or “indicates,” its referent; and in a symbol the
relation is a matter of convention and thus depends on the interpretive habits of those who
use the symbol. Diagrams, cartoons, scale models, and acts of impersonation are all icons,
because their interpretations depend on some perceived similar-
ity between a signifier and a signified. Footprints and medical
symptoms are indices, because they are indications of the things
that cause them. Similarly, smoke is an index of fire, puddles an
index of rain, and skid marks on a highway are an index of a car’s
abrupt stop. Such icons and indexes are not conventional.
All words and morphemes are symbols. There are also non-lin-
guistic symbols, such as coins, stamps, letters, numerals, and
national flags. Certain images can also be symbols: the bald eagle is a symbol of the United
States; doves are a symbol of peace; and roses are a symbol of love and beauty. Some of these
associations are so well established that they feel almost natural, but they are all in fact cul-
tural conventions: roses may be inherently beautiful, but they are a symbol of beauty only
to the extent that certain communities habitually interpret them that way.
```
### SIDEBAR 7.2

```
The concept of “indexicality” is
central to much of the discussion
in Chapter 11, which considers the
ways in which speakers use language
to “index” (point to) their identities.
```

**168 Michael Israel**

```
These three kinds of signs are not, in fact, mutually exclusive; the link between signifier
and signified is often motivated in multiple ways. A footprint, for example, both resembles
and is causally connected to the foot that made it, and is therefore both an icon and an
index. Similarly, a stick figure is a kind of icon, since it resembles the thing it represents, but
it is also a conventional way of representing a person and as such is also a symbol.
```
### STOP AND REFLECT 7.2 EMOTICONS AND EMOJI: ICONS, INDEXES, OR

### SYMBOLS?

```
Emoticons were originally representations of facial expressions produced typographically, such as :-) and :-(.
Later, technologies began to replace them with images such as and , and now the set has significantly
expanded to include images such as and. To what extent are these six images iconic, indexical, or
symbolic? To what extent are they conventional?
```
```
All linguistic signs are governed by convention and hence are symbols, but many
words and expressions have an iconic or indexical aspect as well. Probably all lan-
guages have onomatopoetic words for different sorts of sounds, like the English verbs buzz,
crackle, crunch , and tinkle , or their French counterparts vrombir, crepiter, croquer , and tintin-
nabuler. Words depicting exclamations, like ow, ooh, ah , and aargh , and animal sounds, like
woof, meow, moo , and roar , are also perhaps universally imitative, and therefore iconic. But
the particular forms such words take is also a matter of convention and so varies from lan-
guage to language (see Textbox 7.2).
Finally, all languages include an important class of expressions that combine the features
of a symbol and an index – forms which conventionally point to a contextually salient
referent. Just as the interpretation of a pointing finger depends on where it is pointing, the
interpretation of words like this, here, now, I , and you depends on the context in which they
are used: the pronoun I refers to the speaker or writer; you refers to the addressee; and here
and now denote the place and time of the utterances in which they occur. Words like these
are deictic expressions , from the Greek word deixis , for ‘pointing.’ Deictic expressions
are symbols, since the association of a linguistic form with a deictic meaning is a conven-
tion (different languages have different words for I , and even different inventories of deictic
expressions); but deictics are also indexical, because their precise significance on any given
occasion depends on the context in which they occur.

7.3 Sense and Reference
Thus far we have said a lot about the ways meanings can be linked to linguistic forms, but
little about just what meanings are. What exactly is it that gets expressed by language? Not
surprisingly, there is no simple answer to this question, but there are at least two obvious
ways one might think about it. On the one hand, language allows us to talk about things
in the world, and so we might think of meaning directly in terms of reference , as the stuff
“out there” in the world that we use language to talk about. On the other hand, and just
as importantly, language allows us to express our inner thoughts and to influence those of
others, so we might think of meaning precisely as the stuff of thought, as the conceptual
contents “in our heads” that trigger and respond to the use of language. Ultimately a good
theory of semantics has to explain both sorts of phenomena.
The idea that meaning is just a matter of reference seems intuitive. The meaning of an
expression would just be its referents, the set of things it refers to in the world. So the
meaning of dog would be the set of all dogs, the meaning of wet would be the set of all wet
things, and the meaning of a sentence like The dog is wet would be a situation in which a
particular individual is both wet and a dog. Part of the appeal of an approach like this is
that it offers a way of understanding how the meanings of complex expressions like The dog
is wet are built up from the meanings of their parts. Textbox 7.3 further discusses the idea
of composite meanings.
If we only focus on the way words refer to entities in the world, we will miss some
important aspects of linguistic meaning. The following are three reasons why there
must be more to a word’s meaning than just what it refers to.
```
### STOP AND REFLECT 7.3 SOUND SYMBOLISM

```
Although linguistic signs are always arbitrary, the link between form and meaning can be at least partially
motivated, and some sounds seem to be especially well suited for some meanings. In a famous experiment,
the gestalt psychologist Wolfgang Köhler showed subjects two different figures, one like (a), with sharp,
jagged edges, and the other like (b), with smooth, sinuous curves. He then asked which of two names takete
or baluba (or in a later version maluma ) best fit each shape.
```
```
The responses he got turned out to be remarkably consistent.
i. Conduct a survey of some friends. Do people tend to agree in their choices?
ii. What acoustic or articulatory properties in these words do you think might contribute to this effect? Note
that the two words have exactly the same length, syllable structure, and frequency of use (i.e., zero) in
ordinary discourse.
```
```
(A) (B)
```

**170 Michael Israel**

### TEXTBOX 7.3 THE PRINCIPLE OF COMPOSITIONALITY

```
All human language, it seems, obeys a principle of
compositionality : in general the meanings of complex
expressions depend on the meanings of their parts,
and individual expressions have stable meanings that
combine in regular ways.
If human languages were not at least partly
compositional, they would be unlearnable. If word
meanings changed randomly from context to context,
speakers would not be able to predict the meanings of
sentences they had never heard before, like A penguin
explained the commotion.
But spoken languages need not be, and typically are
not, perfectly compositional. Two features of language
```
```
particularly tend to complicate the picture. First, in
most languages, frequent words are often polysemous,
i.e., have multiple senses, so the contribution they
make will vary from one expression to another. The
English verb run is polysemous because it can refer to
rapid two-legged motion, to the action of a machine,
or the action of campaigning for elected office.
Moreover, most languages also include a wide variety
of idioms , that is, complex expressions the senses of
which are not a regular function of their parts. Familiar
English idioms include sit tight, kill time , and be up in
the air (about something).
```
```
t Reason (1) Different expressions can refer to the same things but still differ in other aspects
of meaning. For example, the technical term canine and the diminutive doggie both refer to
the same set of things as does the word dog , but they do so in very different ways. Words
that refer to exactly the same sets of things, but which still differ in meaning, are said to
have a common denotation, but different connotations (see Textbox 7.4).
t Reason (2) Many expressions – like unicorn and centaur and the king of Mars – lack any refer-
ents in this world. Some denote things that could exist in another possible world. Others, like
hornless unicorn and the intersection of two parallel lines , seem to denote things that in principle
could not exist in any world. At least in this world, such expressions have exactly the same set
of possible referents: the set that has no members, the empty set. But their meanings clearly
differ; each makes one think of a very different sort of thing that happens not to exist.
t Reason (3) Some important kinds of meaning do not involve reference at all. Expressions
like if, although , and because do not help to depict an actual situation; rather, they signal
logical relations between propositions. Many words – like only, very, whether, not, or , and
maybe – have big effects on sentence meanings without affecting what a sentence refers to.
```
### TEXTBOX 7.4 DENOTATION AND CONNOTATION

```
The term denotation refers to the thing, state, or
event that a linguistic expression refers to in the real
world, or some larger set of possible worlds. Thus, a
linguistic expression denotes a set of possible referents.
Connotation , by contrast, encompasses all of the
non-referential effects that can arise from the use of an
expression. There are in fact many kinds of connotative
meanings. The following are just three.
The words dog, doggie , and canine have the same
denotation but different connotations. They belong to
different registers and so tend to occur in different social
contexts: dog is neutral, but doggie is used with small
```
```
children, and canine only in certain scientific contexts.
(Register is discussed in more detail in Section 11.2.)
The words spare and deprive can both be used to
denote withholding something from someone, but
they differ in their emotive content : sparing someone
sounds like a good thing (emotionally positive), while
depriving someone sounds bad (emotionally negative).
Finally, two sentences can refer to exactly the same
situation, but present it in very different ways: whether
we say of a party half the guests stayed past 10 or half
the guests left by 10 depends not on the situation itself,
but on our perspective on it.
```

**171 7 Semantics**

```
For these and other reasons, it makes sense to think of reference as an effect of meaning,
rather than a part of it. Ultimately what an expression actually refers to on any occasion of
use is a matter of pragmatics. The semantic content of an expression, its sense, is not what
it refers to, but how it refers: the concept it activates in one’s mind. There is thus a three-
way relation between a word (or any sign), its sense, and its reference: the word evokes a
concept in the mind of a language user, and that concept, which is the word’s sense,
is what determines its possible referents.
Figure 7.1 shows the Semiotic Triangle, which illustrates the relationship between refer-
ence (a real or imagined cat), linguistic expression (in English, the word /kæt/), and sense
(the concept of ‘cat’ in the mind of a given speaker).
A sense, in effect, is a kind of prompt to imagine something or to compose a thought
in a particular way. Senses are thus psychological entities, but since language is a tool for
communication, senses are not purely subjective. Senses are experienced subjectively, but
like all conventions, senses must be shared within a community, and so they are essentially
intersubjective (that is, they are experienced as communal knowledge). Basically, the
sense of a word is what an ordinary speaker would expect any other ordinary speaker to
expect it to mean.
Most expressions seem to have a fairly clear core sense, often in the form of one or a few
properties that define a class of entities. The sense of unicorn , for example, is not the set of
things that are or could be unicorns, but the set of properties that make something count
as a unicorn. The core sense includes at least the features of (i) being a horse [+equine] and
(ii) having a horn [+horned]. Other properties – like being mythically pure and gentle and
typically white – may or may not be part of the core but will be widely recognized as typi-
cal, if not strictly necessary (judgments here may vary some). Since there are no [+equine,

```
+horned] animals in this world, the word unicorn has no referents here. But it is easy to
understand why; in fact, it is precisely its sense that makes it not refer.
The distinction between sense and reference is perhaps clearest in the interpretation of
deictics like this, here, I , and you. As noted above, deictics in general function simultane-
ously as indices and as symbols: they are symbolic because their meanings are always a
matter of linguistic convention; but they are also indexical since their value on any occa-
sion depends on the context of use. Thus, the interpretation of a sentence like That’s the
man I saw yesterday depends on, at least, (i) when it is said, for the meaning of yesterday ; (ii)
who says it, for the meaning of I ; and (iii) what the speaker is indicating by the use of that.
But it is only the reference of these words that changes from one context to another; their
senses stay the same. Each one always picks out its referent in exactly the same way: I always
points to the speaker, yesterday to the day before the time of speech, and that to a contextu-
ally salient object of attention. Their senses are thus in effect instructions to find a referent.
People use these words to refer, but they succeed in referring because of the words’ senses.
```
7.4 **Expressing Thoughts: Entailments and Contradictions**

```
Senses allow us to use language not only to refer to things in the world, but to express all
sorts of thoughts. The most basic sort of thought is a proposition : the sort of thing that
can be true or false, possible or impossible; something that one could assert, deny, doubt,
or believe. Propositions in general are defined by their truth conditions : the conditions
that have to hold for them to count as true. In order to understand a proposition, one must
know what would have to be the case for it to be true. Thus, one basic aspect of a lexical
item’s sense is its propositional content : the contribution to the truth conditions of an
expressed proposition. (See Textbox 7.5 on morphemes which lack propositional content.)
Normally it takes a full clause to express a full proposition. Paris is the capital of France says
something that could be true or false, but the word Paris on its own does not – it just refers
to a place. The senses of individual words and morphemes are always smaller than a full
proposition, but they are defined by their effects on propositional meaning.
Simple referring expressions like Paris and France can pick out individual entities or sets
of entities, but relational expressions like in, on, own, exist and [ be the capital of ] allow us to
construct predicates – that is, the part of a proposition that is actually proposed , “put forth,”
and predicated about a subject.
Since the semantic and syntactic core of a clause is usually the main verb, let us begin by
considering how the verb kiss contributes to the meaning of the sentence in (5).
```
### TEXTBOX 7.5 DISCOURSE MARKERS

```
Many meaningful expressions have little or no
propositional content. Discourse markers offer some
clear examples of expressions with purely interactional
meaning :
oh, um, uh, well, like, so, anyway, actually I think, I
guess, I mean, you see, you know, know what?
```
```
These are words and expressions that help a
speaker to frame an utterance, express an attitude,
attend to an audience, or coordinate an audience’s
attention.
```

**173 7 Semantics**

```
(5) She kissed him.
The words in (5) form a structured syntactic constituent, a sentence (NP+VP), and so express
a complex meaning, the structure of which partly mirrors its syntax and partly depends on
the lexical meanings of its constituents. Note that this sentence on its own does not express
a “complete thought” unless one knows, among other things, who the pronouns she and him
refer to. Typically, the semantic content of a sentence gives only a
bare outline of an expressed proposition, along with some point-
ers (deictic expressions) to salient aspects of the context. Most
sentences will not express a full proposition (something that can
be true or false) unless they occur in a context that can determine
just what its deictic expressions point to.
Words on their own (like Paris or fish ) do not express propositions, but they do have
propositional content. One might explicate the meaning of kissed as having precisely the
following four truth conditions:
```
```
(6) For any two individuals, x and y, x kissed y is true if and only if:
a. x did something.
b. something happened to y.
c. x deliberately touched y.
d. x used x’s lips to touch y.
The four sentences (6a–d) are entailments of the word kiss. They specify necessary condi-
tions – things that must be true – for something to count as a kiss: that there be (a) an agent
(the kisser) who does something; (b) a patient (the kissee) who is affected; (c) a deliberate
act of touching; and (d) use of the kisser’s lips. For further discussion of truth and meaning,
see Textbox 7.6.
```
### SIDEBAR 7.3

```
The process by which meanings of
deictic expressions are filled in by
inference is discussed in Section 8.2.3.
```
### TEXTBOX 7.6 TRUTH AND MEANING

```
For those unfamiliar with semantic theory, it may seem
odd to think about linguistic meaning in terms of
truth conditions. After all, the meaning of a sentence
does not depend on whether or not the sentence is
true: Pigs can fly is a perfectly meaningful sentence;
it just happens to be false. But part of the reason it is
meaningful is that speakers of English can agree on
its truth conditions – that is, we know what the world
would have to be like for this sentence to be true.
And truth conditions are not just important for
factual assertions, but for jokes and stories as well. If
```
```
someone tells a joke about a panda that walks into
a bar, no one is supposed to think such a thing ever
actually happened. But to understand the joke, one
may at least have to know what the world would be
like if a panda did walk into a bar.
There are also many sorts of sentences for which
truth seems not to be directly relevant. If someone
asks a question like What is the capital of Texas?
they are not saying anything that is either true or
false. Or if someone makes a request like Get me a
doughnut , it would make no sense to answer, “that’s
```
### STOP AND REFLECT 7.4 PROPOSITIONAL SCHEMAS

```
How does the propositional schema of hug differ from that of kiss? What about eat versus feed, hear versus
listen, lie (down) versus stand versus lean , or misspeak versus tell a lie?
```

**174 Michael Israel**

```
One can show that each of the propositional schemas in (6) is an entailment of the word
kiss. Narrowly framed, an entailment is a relation between two propositions, P and Q,
such that P entails Q, if (and only if) whenever P is true, Q is also true. But the term entail-
ment also applies more broadly to any propositional content coded by an expression.
The crucial observation is just that if one calls something a “kiss” and at the same time
denies one of the propositions in (6a–d), the result is a kind of nonsense called a paradox
or contradiction (see Textbox 7.7), where two propositions are asserted which cannot both
be true at once.
```
**(7) a.** # _She kissed him, but she didn’t do anything._
**b.** # _She kissed him, but nothing happened to him._
**c.** # _She kissed him, but her lips didn’t touch him._

```
People tend to have strong intuitions about the entailments of lexical items they are
familiar with, and they tend to notice when a sentence contradicts itself. So a good way to
test whether something is an entailment of a given lexical item is, as in (7), to construct
sentences that assert the lexical item and deny the hypothesized entailment. This is the
“contradiction test.”
```
### TEXTBOX 7.7 SEMANTIC ANOMALY AND HASH NOTATION

```
A sentence is semantically anomalous if it is
structurally (morphosyntactically) well formed but
does not make good sense. A famous example of
a semantically anomalous sentence was coined
by Noam Chomsky in his 1957 book Syntactic
Structures: #Colorless green ideas sleep furiously.
```
```
This sentence contains a number of contradictions,
e.g., an entity cannot be both colorless and green.
Contradiction is one kind of semantic anomaly.
Just as the asterisk (*) marks a word or sentence as
ungrammatical, the hash sign (#) is used to indicate
semantic anomaly.
```
```
true” or “no, you’re lying!” On the other hand, both
questions and requests depend on the expression of
propositions that do have clear truth conditions. The
question about the capital of Texas is, in effect, an
attempt to get someone to name the particular city,
A, that would make the proposition ‘A is the capital
of Texas’ true. Similarly, with a request like Get me a
doughnut , the relevant proposition is ‘you get me a
```
```
doughnut,’ and the speaker in effect expresses a desire
that the addressee should do something to make this
proposition true.
Of course, there is more to meaning than just truth
conditions, but without truth conditional meaning we
could not use language to describe the world as it is or
as it might be, to report the news, ask questions, make
requests, or even tell lies.
```
```
TEXTBOX 7.6 ( cont. )
```
```
The formulae in (6) use variables (x, y) rather than the personal pronouns ( she, he ) in (5),
but the effect is the same: these sentences do not express complete thoughts, but just the
outlines of propositions, which we can call propositional schemas. Schemas like these
allow us to capture the propositional content of a lexeme without actually expressing a
proposition.
```

**175 7 Semantics**

```
(8) a. She kissed the ground when she got off the plane. ‘kiss’ ≠ ‘on a person’
b. She kissed him on the elbow. ‘kiss’ ≠ ‘on the lips’
c. She kissed him {spitefully/angrily/viciously}. ‘kiss’ ≠ ‘affection’
```
```
Note that the same tests with words like heard or trusted do not create contradictions.
Unlike kiss these words lack any entailments about touching or the use of lips (6c and
6d), or even about an actor doing something (6a) or an object being affected (6b). If one
trusts or hears another person, one does not necessarily “do” anything, and to be heard
or trusted one need not be aware of or changed by the experience.
Furthermore, the contradiction test shows that many things one might expect of a kiss
are not part of the word’s core sense. Typically, for example, kisses involve two people kiss-
ing each other on the lips, or maybe somewhere else on the face, either as a sign of affection
or desire. But the fact that none of the sentences in (8) is a contradiction shows that none
of these is actually an entailment of the word.
```
```
This suggests that the core sense of a word like kiss may consist of just a few entailments,
which together distinguish it from all other English verb senses. Of course, there are many
verbs that entail (6a) deliberate action (e.g., promise, praise, consider, throw ) or (6b) an affected
object (e.g., convince, console, fold, squish ). And there is a substantial group that entails touch-
ing (6c), some of which, like pucker and purse , entail the use of lips (6d). But kiss appears to
be the only English verb that includes all and only the entailments in (6): other English verbs
of kissing (e.g., smooch, snog, peck ) each have all of these entailments, plus some others, thus
limiting them to just some kinds of kissing and not others. To explore entailments further,
try the exercise in Stop and Reflect 7.5.
Together the four properties in (6) thus may be sufficient to make something count as a
kiss (everything with all these properties is a kiss); and each is individually necessary for
something to count as a kiss (every kissing event has all of these properties). If this is the
core sense of the verb, then in essence a “kiss” really is just a ‘deliberate touching with the
lips.’
```
### STOP AND REFLECT 7.5 IDENTIFYING ENTAILMENTS IN VERBS OF ‘TOUCHING’

```
Like kiss , each of the verbs slap, tickle, pinch, poke, spank , and wipe denotes a kind of touching event in which
two individuals, a “toucher” and a “touchee,” come into physical contact. For each verb, consider whether its
use normally carries any of the following sorts of entailments:
i. that the toucher act deliberately;
ii. that the toucher use a particular body part or instrument;
iii. that the touchee have a particular kind of surface;
iv. that a particular part of the touchee be affected;
v. that the touchee feel something;
vi. that the contact occur in a particular manner, either gently or forcefully.
Use the contradiction test to identify the core entailments associated with each verb. Are there verbs that
carry all six sorts of entailments listed here? Do the verbs differ much in the number of entailments they
encode? Are there particular sorts of entailments that get encoded more than others?
```

**176 Michael Israel**

7.5 **Dictionaries and Encyclopedias**

```
But is that really all there is to a “kiss”? The four sparse features in (6) may distinguish the
verb kiss from all comparable verbs in the language, but it’s easy to imagine there must be
more to its meaning. A sentence like She kissed him may call to mind certain kinds of kissing
more than others: kissing on the lips, or at least the face, rather than on other parts of the
body; people kissing other people rather than rocks or socks or money; kisses of friendship
or affection or desire rather than kisses of torture, taunting, or interrogation. But how much
of all this gets included in the sense of a word?
In phonology, the distinctive features of a phoneme include just enough information to
distinguish it from other phonemes in a language, and the fine-grained details of pronun-
ciation are a matter of phonetics. Perhaps the semantic content of lexical items is similarly
sparse, and the rich inferences that people may make on the basis of a word’s use are more
a matter of pragmatics than semantics. In that case, a speaker’s “mental dictionary,” or
lexicon , will indicate certain kinds of common entailments in words, while other
sorts of common-sense information about a word’s referents are seen as encyclo-
pedic knowledge.
It can be hard to know where to draw the line between specialized linguistic knowledge
and general world knowledge; ordinary reference dictionaries inevitably include a good
deal of encyclopedic information in their definitions. The three definitions of kiss in (9),
from three widely used English dictionaries , all include more than just the four proposed
entailments in (6).

```
These dictionaries seem to agree that to understand the word kiss one needs to know
something about both how kisses occur, and why. Two offer precise descriptions of the
physical act – the labial gesture. All three note typical contexts for people to kiss, thus
emphasizing the inherently social nature of the act.
But all three definitions here also resort to just listing different functions of kissing, as in
Dictionary.com ’s “affection, love, greeting, etc.” The point of such a list is not to limit the
sense of the word with necessary or sufficient conditions, but rather to give some typical
examples for people to use in thinking about the category. For a discussion of dictionary
paraphrases and the goals of semantic theory, see Textbox 7.8.

**177 7 Semantics**

### TEXTBOX 7.8 MEANING AND PARAPHRASE

```
What one finds in a dictionary definition is very
different from what can be found in a speaker’s mental
lexicon. At best a dictionary can paraphrase a word’s
meaning, using other words to express the same idea.
The dictionary helps us understand a meaning by
giving us another way to describe that meaning, but
this is not at all the same as just having that meaning in
mind in the first place.
A paraphrase can be more or less complete or
precise, but the actual meaning of a word is the
idea itself, not just an alternative way of expressing
that idea. As a practical matter, to talk about word
meanings, or about any other kind of idea, dictionaries
```
```
need to use a language or code of some sort. But
ordinary thought does not depend exclusively on
language: one can imagine a face, for example, without
being able to describe it in words.
Ultimately, in studying linguistic meanings we are
also trying to understand how words connect to
the general, non-linguistic rational abilities, which
allow us, with or without language, to think about
and react to the world both as it is and as it might
be. A theory of semantics must offer some way of
describing these abilities, either as a “ language
of thought ,” or in a dynamic model of human
conceptualization.
```
7.6 **Prototypes**

```
It may be tempting to think of a word’s meaning as a list of simple (binary) features, but
that can make it hard to explain some common ways people use and understand language.
In the ordinary course of events, people often do not – and sometimes cannot – reason
about categories in terms of necessary and sufficient conditions. They tend instead to make
judgments about category membership (e.g., whether or not something counts as a kiss or a
punch or a unicorn) based largely on patterns of resemblance they find to familiar instances
of a category. This kind of basic analogical reasoning is what allows us to use words produc-
tively, relating new instances to familiar categories.
Generally when one imagines an instance of a category, one does not just think of its
most abstract defining properties; instead, one probably begins with fairly rich ideas about
what members of that category are like. These sorts of ideas create prototype effects ,
leading people to recognize and imagine some members of a category more quickly than
others. A single word may have several distinct prototypes. For example, how one imagines
a prototypical kiss depends a lot on how one imagines the kissee , with very distinct images
and events for a hurt child, a newlywed, a grandfather, or a bishop’s ring.
Lexical prototypes often include features that are neither necessary nor sufficient for
category membership, but still seem to be central to a word’s meaning. Take the word
bird. Since all animals that have either a beak or feathers are birds, either one of these
features alone is sufficient to make something count as a bird. On the other hand, since
many animals that are not birds can fly (e.g., bats), and since many birds cannot fly (e.g.,
penguins), the ability to fly is neither necessary nor sufficient to make something a bird.
But most people are very familiar with various kinds of birds that do fly, and so people
can usually expect that other people will think of small, flying, feathered animals, some
```

**178 Michael Israel**

```
of which are brightly colored and sing. With the exception of “feathered,” none of these
features is either necessary or sufficient to make something a ‘bird,’ but the kinds of birds
that share these features tend to be both common and familiar in many parts of the
world, and so for many people they form a kind of prototype for the category of birds
as a whole (see Stop and Reflect 7.6).
```
```
Prototypes play an important role in the meanings of many lexical items because
people typically reason about things and situations in terms of familiar features
and memorable exemplars of similar things. In some cases, this sort of reasoning may
be viewed as a pragmatic effect of language use. In other cases, whole concepts and catego-
ries seem to be organized around one or more salient prototypical examples, in which case
prototype effects may be somehow built into the semantics of an expression.
```
7.7 **Lexical Semantic Relations**

```
Ultimately, the meaning of any lexeme, what it adds to a language, is always partly
a function of its relations with other lexemes : the value of a linguistic expression lies
in its potential to contrast with other expressions in the same
language. There are many ways that lexemes can be semantically
related, but three in particular seem to stand out: (1) identity of
senses, synonymy , (2) inclusion of senses, hyponymy , and (3)
oppositeness of senses, antonymy. Synonyms are words with
similar or identical meanings, like amble and stroll. Antonyms
are lexemes with (somehow) opposite senses, like hot and cold.
And one lexeme is a hyponym of another if its sense is more
specific and it refers to a narrower set of potential referents; thus,
beagle is a hyponym of dog , and indigo is a hyponym of blue.
```
### STOP AND REFLECT 7.6 PROTOTYPES IN CATEGORY STRUCTURE

vii. a scene with a police officer ( p ), a judge ( j ), and a defendant ( d ).
Are there particular shades of red people tend to think of first and most? What sorts of fruits came first to
mind? What sorts of vehicles, games, or weddings? What sorts of things do they imagine p, j , and d might be
doing together or saying to each other?
Can you find any reasons why the sorts of examples people think of first are somehow salient in their
experience?
```
### SIDEBAR 7.4

```
The symbol ⊂ means “is a subset
of,” so A ⊂ B means that A is a
subset of B, or that A is included in B
(A is a hyponym of B).
The symbol ⊃ means “is a superset
of,” so B ⊃ A means that B is a
superset of A, or includes A (B is a
hypernym of A).
```

**179 7 Semantics**

```
Each of these three basic kinds of lexical relations is illustrated in (10), with groups of
English adjectives denoting (i) degrees of wealth, (ii) kinds of human figures, and (iii)
degrees of hot and cold.
Synonymy: i. rich – wealthy – affluent
ii. slender – slim – sleek – lithe – thin
iii. cold – cool – nippy – frosty – frigid
```
```
(10) a.
```
```
b. Hyponymy: i. mega rich ⊂ rich
ii. slim ⊂ thin
iii. glacial ⊂ cold
c. Antonymy: i. rich : poor
ii. chubby : slender
iii. cold : hot
```
```
These basic semantic relations are usually easy to observe among groups of closely related
words, or lexical fields. As a general rule, the more entailments a group of lexemes shares,
the more closely related they will be, and languages tend to have many rather densely pop-
ulated fields of closely related terms. Among verbs of ‘touching,’ for example, we find many
hyponyms (e.g., poke, pat, pet, stroke, kiss ), a few near and partial synonyms (e.g., feel, reach,
contact, abut ), and some opposites (e.g., shun, separate ).
Synonyms are words that share a common sense, having the same – or very similar –
entailments. In general, if any two words had identical meanings, there would be no reason
to have both in the language. Thus, where synonyms can be found in a language, they tend
to differ in some small way, either in a nuance of sense or in their typical contexts of use.
Still, there are many situations where substituting one word for another will have little or
no discernible effect on the meaning of a sentence. (See Textbox 7.9.)
```
### TEXTBOX 7.9 SYNONYMS, ANTONYMS, HYPONYMS AND HYPERNYMS

```
Synonyms share a common sense – though the words
may differ in their social contexts of use: e.g., film,
movie, flick, motion picture, show ; or, cat, feline, tomcat,
kitty ; or, coffee, java, joe.
Antonyms are pairs of words that have opposite
meanings: e.g., dead : alive, hot : cold, easy : difficult,
backward : forward.
```
```
Hyponyms and hypernyms have multiple layers, as
in the following examples, where fry is a hyponym of
the hypernym cook , but fry itself is also a hypernym for
some other types of frying:
Hypernym: cook
Hyponyms: bake, boil, grill, fry, steam, roast
Hypernym: fry
Hyponyms: stir-fry, pan-fry, sauté, deep-fry
```
```
Since words often have multiple senses, two or more words may overlap very precisely in
one or more senses but still exhibit a very different overall range of uses, as in the following
three sets of examples.
Partial overlaps { get, take, see, hear, understand } what someone says
{ stand, stomach, put up with, tolerate } a situation
{ want, lack, need, long for } something
```

**180 Michael Israel**

### SIDEBAR 7.5

```
The concept of register is further
discussed in Section 11.2.1.
```
```
Sometimes the overlap is extensive, resulting in near synonyms:
Near synonyms see, watch, look (at), regard, stare
walk, amble, saunter, stroll, stride, strut
Teasing apart the semantic differences among near synonyms reveals the fine-grained dis-
tinctions lexical items can encode. For example, the ‘seeing’ verbs, above, seem to differ in
the kinds and quantities of effort or attention that they entail.
In other cases, near synonyms may differ not so much in the sorts of situations they
depict, but only in what they imply about how the speaker is judging the situation. Thus,
the words spare and deprive both entail that someone is prevented from having or experi-
encing something, but spare makes it sound like a good thing, while deprive makes it sound
bad. Such evaluative synonyms are not uncommon.
Evaluative synonyms rapid/hasty; slender/skinny; thrifty/cheap; bold/reckless
In other cases, the differences depend on the social context. Some synonyms are usu-
ally used in particular regions, whereas others may vary according to the social context or
register:
Regional variants soda, pop, cola, coke
Register variants automobile, motor vehicle, car, wheels, ride
Languages can and often do differ in the density of a lexical
field. In English the word break applies more or less neutrally
to any object that can lose its structural integrity. K’iche’ Maya
appears to lack any similarly neutral equivalent and instead uses
a variety of more specific roots, many of which encode some-
thing about the manner of breaking or the type of material that
gets broken. The twelve verb roots in (ii) come from a list of forty-two different K’iche’ Maya
“Breaking and Cutting Verbs” reported by Pye (1996) and include all the most common
translations for English break. (See Stop and Reflect 7.7.)
```
**(11)** K’iche’ Maya verbs of ‘breaking’

```
-chiko:j ‘break a thing by throwing it (e.g., chest, stool, pot)’
-joyopi:j ‘break a banana from a bunch of bananas’
-mich’ ‘chop (e.g., a plant); pluck (e.g., feathers, pine needles)’
-paxi:j ‘break a solid thing (e.g., clay, rock, glass, plate, cup, pot)’
-pi’i:j ‘break a soft thing (e.g., book, tortilla, clay, hardboiled egg)’
-pitz’itz’e:j ‘crush a soft thing (e.g., clay)’
-q’upi:j ‘break a hard thing (e.g., bridge, candle, basket, stick, chair, tooth)’
-raqi:j‘ ‘smash a hollow thing (e.g., glass, pot, plate, chest, bubble)’
-sak’ij ‘crack a surface (e.g., wall, melon, plate, glass, skull, tree, board)’
-t’oqopi:j ‘break/snap a long flexible thing (e.g., rope, wire, string)’
-weqi:j ‘break/smash a hard thing (e.g., pot, wall, stone griddle, mile post)’
```
- _woqi:j_ ‘break/shatter a fragile thing (e.g., eggs, vase, light bulb)’


**181 7 Semantics**

```
Hyponymy is a relation between two words, one of which is more specific than the other: an
expression A is a hyponym of another expression B if and only if the denotation of A is a
proper subset of the set of entities denoted by B (in which case B is also considered a hyper-
nym of A). For example, since a queen is necessarily a woman, and (in the Catholic Church)
a pope is necessarily a man, queen is a hyponym of woman and pope is a hyponym of man.
In general, hyponyms are both more specific and thus in ordinary assertions more
informative, than their hypernyms. Thus, the words amble, saunter, stride, stroll , and march
are all hyponyms of walk : each has all the entailments that walk does, plus one or two more.
Similarly aged, ancient, antique, decrepit , and senile are hyponyms of old since they can all be
paraphrased by old , but each applies to a much narrower range of referents than does old.
For more examples of hyponyms and hypernyms, see Textbox 7.9. Sometimes hypo-
nymic relationships combine to form taxonomies, as shown in Textbox 7.10.
```
### TEXTBOX 7.10 TAXONOMIES

```
Nature tiger ĺ carnivore ĺ mammal ĺ vertebrate
emperor penguin ĺ penguin ĺ bird ĺ creature
Art cleaver ĺ knife ĺ tool ĺ thing
spinach ĺ greens ĺ veggies ĺ food ĺ stuff
Movement amble ĺ walk ĺ move
trot ĺ run ĺ locomote
```
```
The familiar term antonym is used both broadly, for any pair of words with opposite
meanings, and more narrowly just for contrary (or gradable) antonyms – terms that desig-
nate opposite regions of a scale with some intermediate range of values between them: e.g.,
hot : cold, long : short, fast : slow , and big : little (see Textbox 7.9). Contraries cannot both be
true of the same entity in the same way, but they can both be false. A drink could be neither
hot nor cold, a book neither long nor short, and a run neither fast nor slow.
But there are other kinds of “oppositeness” too. For example, complementarity is an
opposition where something is either one way or the other: complementaries are pairs of
terms, such that wherever one is true the other is false, and wherever one is false the other
is true. Typical examples include dead : alive, odd : even, present : absent, inside : outside , and
legal : illegal.

K’iche’ Maya seems to lack a broad default like break , but the English word break does have some vivid
hyponyms. Consider words like splatter, shatter, smash, explode, shred , and fracture. What sorts of entailments
do you think these verbs add to those of break? How do these entailments differ from those suggested by the
glosses for the Mayan verbs?
```
```
Many sorts of lexical fields seem intuitively
to be organized by the inclusion relation into
```
```
a branching hierarchy of groups. Such fields
are called taxonomies.
```

**182 Michael Israel**

```
Reversive antonyms are terms denoting either movement in opposite directions –
for example, come : go, give : take , and raise : lower – or change between reversible states,
like melt : freeze, dress : undress , or cover : uncover. And converse antonyms are terms
that denote different participants in a binary relationship, like husband : wife , and student
: teacher , or the same situation from opposite perspectives, as with in-front-of : behind and
above : below.
```
7.8 **Sense and Imagery**

```
In actual discourse, speakers and writers do not just offer up a series of abstract propositions;
they choose propositions based on their communicative goals and formulate them in ways
that highlight their relevance, as discussed in the next chapter. To understand the meaning
of a word, one has to know its entailments, but one also needs to know how it can be used
and what kinds of conceptualizations it can trigger: the imagery it evokes and its effects on
construal. While people tend to think of connotations as loose associations a word might
have for some speakers, imagery and construal are core elements of meaning, integral
to the way expressions are understood.
The imagery of a linguistic expression includes not just visual images, but all the tactile,
auditory, olfactory, physical-sensory, and motor associations it regularly triggers. Thus, to
sort out the senses of bipedal motion verbs like amble, saunter, stroll , and traipse , the rele-
vant images would include not just pictures of people walking, but also motor memories of
walking in a leisurely way.
Imagery is just one facet of construal, which includes all aspects of the way an expressed
meaning is brought to mind and imagined. Construal is what explains how two expressions
can denote precisely the same set of situations and yet differ dramatically in their mean-
ings. Usually, it’s because they somehow trigger different ways of building up a conceptu-
alization. And since conceptualization is a complicated process, there are many kinds of
construal one could consider.
The phenomenon of fictive motion is a good place to start. In (12) the motion verb ran
presents a static situation as if it were dynamically unfolding.
```
**(12) a.** _A long scar ran from her hip to her knee_.
**b.** _A long scar ran from her knee to her hip._

```
There is no actual movement except in the virtual gaze of a conceptualizer, and the differ-
ent wordings in (12) thus correspond to different ways one can build up a mental image or
scan an imagined scene.
The contrast in (13), on the other hand, depends on an effect of figure–ground reversal.
Here the difference lies not in how the image gets built up in the mind, but rather in where
the focus of attention is, on what gets profiled as the primary figure (or profile ) in a scene
and what is left in the background. Thus (13a) profiles a playground and locates it in a
shadow, while (13b) profiles a shadow and locates it at a playground. The two expressions
describe the same situation but construe it in different ways.
```

**183 7 Semantics**

```
(13) a. the [playground] [in the shadow of the tree].
b. the [shadow] [of the tree on the playground].
```
```
This kind of figure–ground reversal has many manifestations
in both thought and language. The contrast between the active
and passive sentences in (14) illustrates a similar sort of alter-
nation. Again there is no difference in entailments: it is just a
matter of which participant – the kisser or the kissee or both
together – stands out as the primary figure in the scene.
```
```
(14) a. She kissed him.
b. He was kissed by her.
c. They kissed.
```
```
Another important aspect of construal concerns the way an expression’s entailments are
entered into the discourse. Not all entailments are created equal. A few come out posed in
actual assertions or questions or denials, but others may slip in as a kind of background to
what is said.
A presupposition is a proposition which comes embedded in the use of a construction
and so gets expressed without being asserted. Thus, for example, the adverb again profiles the
repetition of an event, but it presupposes the event’s prior occurrence. So both They kissed
again and They didn’t kiss again presuppose that there was a kiss in the past, but they make
contradictory assertions about the occurrence of any later kissing
(see Stop and Reflect 7.8).
Presuppositional senses are not at all rare, though where
they occur, they are likely to go unnoticed. Normally, as one
processes the successive utterances in a discourse, one focuses
only on what is new at that moment, and so sentences are
usually expressed in ways that highlight new information against the background of
what is known or assumed. Presuppositions thus serve an important role in relating the
expressed content of an utterance to information shared by the discourse participants.

e. They are still kissing.
f. The kiss was brief.
```

**184 Michael Israel**

7.9 **The Structure of a Sense: Profile and Frame**

```
Presuppositions are just one way that the entailments of an expression can be backgrounded.
The sense of any linguistic expression consists of some profiled content construed
against a background frame. Profiling is at the heart of word meaning, and of linguistic
meaning more generally, because linguistic communication is largely a matter of directing
the flow of attention.
A frame is a coherent facet of conceptual structure that provides the basis for under-
standing one or more semantically related expressions. The profile is the part of an evoked
frame that an expression designates. Thus, the word hypotenuse profiles a line segment
within the frame of a particular sort of geometric arrangement, a right triangle. Without
this frame, there could be no such thing as a hypotenuse. Similarly, a word like door pro-
files a part of a room, and words like mother, brother , and uncle profile different individuals
framed by a network of family relations.
Sometimes the division of labor between profile and frame is obvious. Consider the con-
cept of a ‘door.’ Thinking of a door, you might imagine a flat object that moves on hinges
and covers an entryway, and that can be opened or closed to either allow or prevent access
into a room. To imagine a door, one must first imagine an enclosed space, that is a ‘room
that one could enter or leave.’ And to imagine a room, one could also imagine a larger
structure of some sort that the room might be part of. Thus, the word door profiles an
element within the “room” frame, while room itself profiles an element in the “building”
frame. Ultimately, the word building itself also depends on other very general frames (also
sometimes called semantic domains) for things like three-dimensional space and human
artifacts.
The profile of a word often represents a prominent part of the frame to which it belongs.
Thus, a hypotenuse is one part of a right triangle; a lid is one part of a jar or box; a finger is
part of a hand. Some words, however, profile an entity or a condition that somehow devi-
ates from the normal background frame. Words like dent and wrinkle , for example, profile
discontinuities in a surface that one might expect to be smooth; similarly, adjectives like
empty and absent profile temporary conditions in which an entity of some sort does not
appear where it might have been expected.
Often words with closely related meanings differ only in their profiles. For example,
the English word dream functions both as a verb – in which case it profiles the process of
dreaming as it unfolds in time – and as a noun, in which case it profiles the thing which is
envisioned in that process. Similarly, the English agentive suffix - er in words like dreamer
and runner switches the profile of a root from the process as a whole to a participant in that
process.
Often a single lexeme on its own can evoke a whole ensemble of culturally specific
frames. To understand the meanings of terms like line drive, ground ball , and a pop fly , one
must know not only that these terms denote ways of hitting a baseball but what a baseball
game is in general. And to know what it means to call, raise, fold, bluff , or draw a straight
flush , one needs to know that these are things one can do in a game of poker (see Stop and
Reflect 7.9).
```

**185 7 Semantics**

```
Frames involving knowledge of complex events or scenarios are sometimes called scripts.
Common-sense knowledge about restaurants, for example, is organized around the sorts of
events that take place in a restaurant: e.g., seating, ordering, eating, clearing, paying, and
tipping. Without some background and culturally based knowledge of this complex script,
one cannot begin to understand words like waiter, menu, tip , and reservation. Scripts in gen-
eral are useful for describing basic sorts of social knowledge, like how one should behave
and what one can expect on a doctor’s visit, at a birthday party, on a picnic, or in a linguis-
tics seminar.
```
### STOP AND REFLECT 7.9 SEMANTIC FRAMES

```
Charles Fillmore, a leading figure in semantic theory, stated “to understand what any one member of the
group is about is, in a sense, to understand what they are all about” (Fillmore 1985: 223). Consider each
of the following lists of words and how the meaning of each word in part depends on the meanings of the
others. If you use one word, it is naturally profiled against others within that frame. How would you name the
frame represented by each group of words? Which of these frames are culturally specific?
Monday, Tuesday , Wednesday, Thursday, Friday The_____Frame
tall, grande, venti, trenta The_____Frame
enroll, attend, study, pass, fail, graduate The_____Frame
defend, retreat , defeat, surrender The_____Frame
```
```
(15) a. Chuck sold the box to George for $12.
b. George bought the box from Chuck for $12.
c. George paid Chuck $12 for the box.
d. The box cost George $12.
```
```
Evidently, words like buy and sell describe the same sort of situation with the same sorts
of participants engaged in the same basic activities, but they do so in different ways. In
order to understand the meanings of these words, one needs to understand that the situ-
ations to which they apply always feature certain participants
(or frame elements ) with certain semantic relations (i.e.,
case roles ) among them. In particular, there has to be a buyer,
a seller, some money, and an item to be exchanged; the buyer
must give money to the seller, and the seller in return must give
the item to the buyer.
One can then analyze the meanings of lexemes like buy, sell, cost , and pay as profiling
different sorts of entities or relations against the background of the Commercial Event
Frame. Thus, buy profiles a scene in which the primary figures are the buyer and the goods,
```
### SIDEBAR 7.8

```
See Section 6.3.5 for a detailed
introduction to semantic case roles.
```
```
Another well-known script, the Commercial Event Frame, provides the conceptual basis for
words like buy, sell, cost , and pay , among many others. Imagine that Chuck has a beautiful box
that he gives to George in exchange for $12. In such a situation, all of the sentences below will
be equally true. But while these sentences all depict the same situation, they each have their
own distinct meanings because of how they are construed.
```

**186 Michael Israel**

```
and the other participants are left unmentioned or else expressed less prominently in an
oblique phrase (i.e., out of the spotlight that falls on the subject and object in a clause). And
sell denotes exactly the same sort of scene, except it profiles the seller and the goods as the
primary figures.
```
7.10 **Framing Motion Events: Cross-Linguistic Differences**

```
As we have seen, words for games, food, art, and clothes can be
richly framed. This is also true of more basic sorts of words where
the framing involves much more basic aspects of experiences
and so can be easy to overlook. Consider a situation in which
an entity moves from one place to another. To describe such
a situation, one would probably depict the moving entity – or
theme – as the primary participant, and the path it moves on –
from start to finish – as part of the background frame. But there
are many other details one might attend to in a motion event,
as can be seen in Textbox 7.11, and different languages tend to
present this information in different ways.

Path: What is the route of motion? e.g., a straight
line, zigzag, etc.
Direction: Is the motion toward or away from a
reference point?
```
```
Medium: Is the motion on land, or through water,
air, mud, or something else?
Means: What causes the motion? e.g., foot, hoof, wing,
car, bus, boat, etc.
```
```
Rate: How fast is the movement?
```
```
The sentences in (16) are fairly typical of the way motion events tend to be expressed in
English. They have a set of fairly standard entailments. In each of these sentences the sub-
ject NP denotes a theme, that is, an entity that moves along a path, and the prepositional
phrase adjunct depicts a path, while the verbs slither, saunter, scamper , and crawl each profile
a different manner of motion.
```
**(16) a.** _The snake slithered across the floor._
**b.** _The actor sauntered out of the room._
**c.** _The mouse scampered through the bushes._
**d.** _The baby crawled toward the kitten._

```
This is the way Chinese, English, and most other Indo-European languages tend to
express motion events, with the means and manner expressed in the verb nucleus, while
```

**187 7 Semantics**

```
path and direction get specified by phrases and particles lower in the verb phrase, toward
the periphery of the clause, as in (17).
```
```
(17) a. The bottle manner [ floated ]path [ into the cave ].
b. The children manner [ jumped ]path [ down the stairs ].
```
```
But Romance languages (and many others, including Semitic, Polynesian, Nez Perce, and
Caddo) tend to express direction directly in the verb and relegate the manner of motion
to the clause periphery. Thus in (18), the French counterparts to (17) have main verbs that
express a direction of motion (i.e., entrer ‘go in’ and descendre ‘go down’), while the manner
of motion is optionally specified by a verb at the end of the clause.
(18) a. la bouteille est entrée dans la grotte en flottant
DET bottle AUX go.into.PST in DET cave floating
b. les écoliers ont descendu l’escalier en sautant
DET schoolchild.PL AUX go.down.PST DET.staircase jumping
In some other languages, one finds an abundance of motion verbs that entail some-
thing about the moving figure. In Atsugewi, an extinct polysynthetic language of Northern
California, many verb roots expressing motion or location also have specific entailments
about the kind of theme that moves or is located.
```
```
(19) Atsugewi verb roots
-lup- ‘for small shiny spherical objects to move/be-located’
-t’- ‘for smallish flat objects to move/be-located’
-caq- ‘for a slimy lumpish object to move/be-located’
-qput- ‘for loose dry dirt to move/be-located’
-st’aq’- ‘for runny icky material to move/be-located’
It is difficult to capture these entailments except by listing the kinds of themes they
involve. The - lup - root applies to things like round candies, eyeballs, and hailstones; the - t ’-
root is used for things like a stamp, a clothing patch, a button, or a shingle; the -caq- root
might be used of a toad or a cow dropping; the - st’aq’ - root covers things like mud, manure,
rotten tomatoes, guts, or chewed gum.
By comparing the semantics of motion verbs across languages, we can see that
languages package information differently , with some incorporating particular aspects
of the motion event into the core meaning of verb roots, and others indicating these mean-
ings in root-external morphemes or phrases.
```
7.11 **Polysemy: Relations between Senses**

```
It often happens that two or more words in a language can have the same form, but no
real semantic connections. English, for example, has two words flatter , one a lexical verb
meaning ‘to fulsomely praise,’ the other the comparative form of the adjective flat. These
words are homonyms , because their formal similarity is just coincidence. But it often
happens that a single word in a language will have a number of distinct but more or less
closely related senses. Such words are polysemous. Polysemy is the property of having
```

**188 Michael Israel**

```
multiple ( poly -) meanings ( sem -). This is, in fact, the normal condition for most common
lexemes.
In polysemy, the different senses of an expression must be both distinct and
related. For example, the word hand occurs both as a noun denoting the part of the body
at the end of the arm, or as a transitive verb denoting the action of transferring an object
from one person’s hand to another. These two senses clearly have something in common,
and so hand is polysemous.
Polysemy contrasts with vagueness , where a single word encompasses a broad range
of referents not because it has multiple senses, but because it has one very general sense.
The noun thing and the verb do are perhaps maximally vague, since they can be used in
reference to almost any entity or action, respectively. But all lexemes, with the possible
exception of some proper nouns, are vague in at least some respects. Chair , for example, is
vague with respect to the color, material, and number of legs an object must have to count
as a ‘chair.’ Similarly, the English word uncle is vague in that it refers to a brother either of
one’s mother or of one’s father, though many other languages have distinct terms for these
two relations (e.g., in Latin avunculus , ‘mother’s brother,’ and patruus , ‘father’s brother’).
(See Stop and Reflect 7.10.)
```
**(20)** Sentence with context Possible substitutes
a. She _cried_ out in pain. ‘yelled (non-verbal)’
b. “Buttons for sale,” she _cried_. ‘shouted (verbal)’
c. She _cried_ for hours when the mouse died. ‘sobbed, wept’

```
The substitution test helps us to identify different senses and sub-senses of lexical items,
but its results are always open to interpretation. For instance, cry could be analyzed as hav-
ing just one abstract sense encompassing a wide range of vocal behaviors, of which words
like yell, weep, shout , and sob each profile a specific sort. Or one might argue that cry has a
specific prototype in the ‘weep’ sense from which other uses are extended.
```
### STOP AND REFLECT 7.10 ‘HANDS’ AND ‘ARMS’

```
Body-part terms in different languages often differ in their extensions. The World Atlas of Language Structures
( WALS ) identifies 228 languages that have a single word for both ‘hand’ and ‘arm,’ and 389 that use two or
more distinct words for these concepts. For instance, Chai (Nilo-Saharan; Ethiopia) has separate words for
‘hand,’ síyó , ‘forearm,’ múní , and ‘upper arm,’ yíró , but none for ‘arm.’
Words that denote both ‘hand’ and ‘arm’ can be found in the Oceanic language, Lonwolwol ( va ), Czech
( ruka ), and the Niger-Congo language, Gurma ( nu ). Given that other languages often have separate words
here, should these general ‘hand/arm’ words be analyzed as vague or polysemous? What kinds of evidence
might help to decide?
```
```
One way to distinguish among the different senses of a word is to look for other words
which can substitute for that word in at least some contexts without substantially changing
what is said. The following uses of cry , for example, require different substitutions, and so
arguably involve distinct senses of the word.
```

**189 7 Semantics**

```
When words do have multiple related senses, those senses must be somehow connected,
and the most common connections among senses tend to involve either metaphor or
metonymy (or sometimes both). In classical rhetoric, metaphor and metonymy are ways
of using an expression that somehow shift the expression away from its original sense.
In metaphor, a term whose sense belongs primarily in one semantic frame gets shifted to
another frame, often based on some perceived resemblance between the two: thus, a word
like flower may be applied to a woman or generally to someone young and beautiful; a word
like path may apply to any way of achieving a goal; and the word up can denote things like
happiness, alertness, or increase, in addition to just vertical elevation. In metonymy, the
sense shifts from one element to another within a single frame, based on a principle of
contiguity: classic metonymies include relations of part for whole ( all hands on deck! ), place
for event ( remember the Alamo! ), instrument for action ( go bicycling ), and cause for effect (to
suffer minor burns ). If one describes a man as married to his job , that is a metaphor, since jobs
and marriage are very different kinds of things, but if one locates one’s car by saying I’m
parked out back , that is metonymy, since the speaker ( I ) and the car are very different sorts
of things but are saliently connected in the ownership frame.
Often one can find both metaphor and metonymy at work in a single expression. Thus
in lend me your ears , the association of ears with attention is metonymic, since ears are for
listening and listening is part of paying attention; but lend is used metaphorically, since
its basic sense of physical transfer is extended to the frame of mental attention (as it is in
expressions like pay attention and give a look ).
Certain patterns of polysemy are so common as to be almost entirely predictable ,
and such patterns often involve metonymy of one sort or another. For example, one can use
the name of a country, like France , to profile: (i) a place (as in France is a beautiful country );
(ii) a government (as in France has broken off relations with Belgium ), or other representative
entities, like a soccer team (as in France won the game ).
Similarly, we can use the name of a periodical publication, P , like Time or The Washington
Post , to designate the company that publishes it ( P has offices all around the world ), the
published content of the periodical ( Jack reads P online ), or the physical publication itself
( Maggie uses P to line her birdcage ).
And the name of a play or novel, like Hamlet or Wuthering Heights , can be used in refer-
ence to a text (as in She’s been studying Hamlet for years ), to a physical instance of the text (as
in I left my Hamlet on the train ), or to a theatrical or filmed production of the play. And of
course the title Hamlet itself is based on another common metonymy, where the name of a
main character stands for the whole of a story.
Certain kinds of metaphorical extensions are also very common in polysemous
terms. For example, color terms are used for emotions (e.g., He’s feeling blue), perception
verbs are used to describe thoughts (e.g., I see what you mean or She felt certain ), spatial terms
are applied to time (e.g., the length of time ), and body-part meanings get extended to spatial
relations (e.g., in back of; the head of the line ).
Many of the most common metaphors are not based on resemblance, but rather on
correlations in experience. Thus, we speak of people metaphorically as “warm” or “cold”
(that is, ‘sympathetic’ or ‘hostile’), not because sympathy is similar to heat, but because the
```

```
190 Michael Israel
```
```
experience of physical warmth from a human body is an important part of some of our most
basic experiences of human sympathy: for instance, in a baby’s experience of being held
and soothed, and in other salient contexts where human warmth and affection are regularly
correlated. Because certain aspects of human experience are universal, some metaphors are
commonly found cross-linguistically; see Textbox 7.12.
```
### TEXTBOX 7.12 METAPHORS FOR “DIFFICULTY” ACROSS LANGUAGES

```
Even very basic concepts may be susceptible to multiple
metaphorical construals. The concept of ‘difficulty,’
for example, can be imagined in terms of heaviness
or hardness. In English one speaks of problems as
“hard” or “tough” if they are difficult to solve, and as
“weighty” or “heavy” if they are severe or important.
In French, similarly the word dur is used for both
“hard” problems and “hard” objects, and grave, lourd ,
```
```
and pesant are used both for things that are literally
heavy, and so difficult to carry, and for abstract things
that are difficult to cope with.
The same or similar ‘heavy’~’difficult’ polysemy can
be found in many unrelated languages around the
world: for example, Latin ( gravis ), German ( schwer ),
Old Irish ( tromm ), Mandarin ( zhóng ), Arabic ( thaquil ),
Hausa ( naunaya ), and Hawaiian ( kaumaha ).
```
```
Similarly, for talk about everyday plans and events, we can use the basic vocabulary of
space and motion ( come, go, near, far, slow, fast ). Thus, people “set goals,” “pass milestones,”
and “overcome obstacles”; and projects “move forward” or “grind to a halt,” but they always
“come to an end.” Moving around in physical space is one of the first and most important
sorts of purposeful activities that humans ever experience, and it seems to provide a useful
and adaptable template for thinking about plans and purposes in general.
Often, if not always, the metaphors in a language extend the use of a lexical field from
relatively vivid and concrete aspects of experience (like lifting and carrying heavy objects)
to more abstract sorts of experiences (like making plans or solving problems) or to domains
that are otherwise hard to talk about or imagine (like time and emotion). This appears to be
a robust and consistent feature of the way metaphors are used in everyday language.
Partly because of this, metaphorical expressions often seem like a vivid or colorful way of
expressing an otherwise plain idea. But there are many pretty basic ideas that are difficult
to think about at all without metaphor. Thus, we tend to use words with basically spatial
and physical entailments – e.g., high/low, rise/fall, peak/abyss – for speaking and reasoning
about very basic, but relatively abstract notions like “happy” and “sad,” “good” and “bad,”
and “more” and “less.”
In these and many other similar cases, the metaphorical use of language seems to reflect a
general pattern of thought, that is, a conceptual metaphor in which a complex semantic
frame is structured, in whole or in part, by analogy with another semantic frame. People
tend to use language metaphorically precisely because they think metaphorically in general
(see Stop and Reflect 7.11).
Sometimes what starts out as metaphor or metonymy can become a conventionalized
sense of a word. If an expression gets used in a way that consistently triggers a metaphoric
or a metonymic inference, that inference can become so automatic that it will no longer
depend on context to be understood. At that point, semantic change has occurred.

### CHAPTER SUMMARY

```
Linguistic signs are prompts to imagine and attend to the world in particular ways. The
semantic content of a linguistic expression – its sense – is always only a starting point for
the process of interpretation, but it is also what allows us to use language to express our
thoughts and to affect the thoughts of others in the first place.
The core sense of any expression, whether a word or a phrase or a larger discourse,
typically includes both some propositional content and some constraints on the way
that content is construed. An expressed proposition may thus be foregrounded as part of
what is said, or backgrounded as a presupposition. In either case, what is actually encoded
by an expression is always much less than what it is likely to communicate in context.
A theory of semantics needs to explain how people represent these encoded contents
and how the encoded meanings of complex expressions are built up from the meanings
of their parts. The next chapter turns to pragmatics, and the ways speakers and hearers
actually use expressions to express themselves and influence others.

```
**2.** The words in each of the following lists have the same denotations but differ in their connotations. For
    each list, state which term is the most neutral and describe the connotations for each alternate term.
    Do you attribute the connotations to differences in register, emotive content, perspective, or something
    else?
    **a.** _She has three kids/offspring/children/rugrats/youngsters._
    **b.** _Last night, I went to sleep/crashed/retired at 11._
    **c.** _The crowd was immense/prodigious/huge/mammoth._
    **d.** _Chris failed/flunked/bombed the exam._
    **e.** _She entered/went in/came in the building._
**3.** List the entailments of each of the following verbs, then argue for your analysis by using the
    contradiction test. In addition, for each verb identify one meaning commonly associated with it, which is
    not, in fact, an entailment. Provide evidence to support your claim. (See Section 7.4.)
    **a.** _kick_
    **b.** _submerge_
    **c.** _smile_
    **d.** _chop_
    **e.** _forget_


**193 7 Semantics**

**4.** The contradiction test allows us to figure out which, if any, parts of an expression’s sense are strictly
    entailed and which, if any, are associated with the category without being strictly necessary. Consider
    at least two words from each of the following lists (i.e., two nouns, two verbs, and two adjectives), and
    for each try to determine the roles that prototypes and entailments have in their meanings. Base your
    reasoning on a few constructed (or found) example sentences illustrating what you take to be a normal
    use of the word in one of its basic senses. Be sure to consider for each word both its precise entailments
    (if any), and just what sorts of information one should include about it in a dictionary.
    N _horse hammer prize bedroom sausage_
    V _stampede steal admire wrestle memorize_
    Adj _bright happy ancient slippery spoiled_
**5.** The _American Heritage College Dictionary_ (3rd edn., 1993) offers the following five senses and sub-senses for
    the noun _window_.
    **i. a.** An opening constructed in a wall or roof that admits light or air to an enclosure and is often
       framed and spanned with glass mounted to permit opening and closing.
    **b.** A framework enclosing a pane of glass for such an opening; a sash.
    **c.** A pane of glass or similar material in such a framework.
    **ii. a.** An opening that resembles a window in function or appearance.
    **b.** The transparent panel on a window envelope.
    **iii.** The area or space behind a window, especially at the front of a shop.
    **iv.** A means of access or observation.
    **v.** An interval of time during which an activity can or must take place.
    Use an online corpus – either the BNC (www.natcorp.ox.ac.uk/), or the COCA (http://corpus.byu.edu/
    coca/) – to search for the word _window_. Find fifteen to twenty examples of uses of the word _window_ , and
    try to sort your data according to which sense or sub-sense is being used. Can you find cases where a
    single instance of the word _window_ is compatible with more than one of these senses? Can you find uses
    that these definitions do not seem to cover? And finally, can you think of anything that clearly is _not_ a
    window that one of these definitions might include?
**6.** Think of two words that are somewhat similar in meaning, but for which you have some intuition about
    what the difference is (example _cup_ and _mug_ ).
    **i.** Write down your own characterization of what differentiates the two.
    **ii.** Ask three other people what they think the difference is, and write down a short summary of their
       responses.
    **iii.** Look up the definitions in at least two different dictionaries.
    **iv.** Discuss the outcomes of your study. What do you consider the core semantic content of each lexeme?
       What is part of our encyclopedic knowledge? What insights did the similarities and differences across
       speakers provide to your study?
**7.** Match the lexical pairs below with the appropriate semantic relations, (a–f). Give evidence for your claims,
    and briefly discuss one or more examples if they pose any difficulties for analysis.
Semantic relations:
    **a.** synonyms **d.** contrary antonyms
    **b.** hyponyms/hypernyms **e.** reversive antonyms
    **c.** complementary antonyms **f.** converse antonyms
Lexical pairs:
    _husband_ and _wife rich_ and _poor long_ and _short_
    _real_ and _genuine car_ and _sedan say_ and _deny_
    _begin_ and _end brother_ and _sister true_ and _false_
    _cruel_ and _kind bird_ and _penguin iPad_ and _tablet_
    _hard_ and _soft hammer_ and _tool pure_ and _sullied_
    _couch_ and _sofa sad_ and _grim girl_ and _boy_


**194 Michael Israel**

**8.** Consider the likely referents of the word _school_ in each of the following sentences: for example, in (a)
    the word _schools_ refers to physical buildings or campuses, but in (b–f) it refers to various kinds of social
    constructions. Use the substitution test to identify and describe the range of referents covered by the word
    _school_ in these sentences. What sorts of semantic and pragmatic relationships (propositional, metaphoric,
    metonymic, etc.) can you observe among the uses of the word _school_ here? How can we best explain the
    wide range of referents this word allows? Are there multiple senses of the word involved, or one very vague
    sense, or are there other ways to explain this data?
    **a.** _Several schools were damaged by the tornado._
    **b.** _Sally and Joey went to the game to root for their school_.
    **c.** _After the game, the whole school gathered to celebrate the victory_.
    **d.** _The school is considering changes in the code on academic honesty._
    **e.** _I can’t make it for lunch. I have school from 10 to 4 on Wednesday._
    **f.** _School sucks._
**9.** For each of the following lexical items, try to determine (a) what each item designates (its profile) and (b)
    what sorts of background knowledge it presupposes (its frame). Discuss any problems you may find in
    drawing these distinctions.
    _denial departure apology gallop tip_
    _dent pedal fish mountain bicycle_
    _hammer_
**10.** Consider the well-known script, the Wedding Frame. Make a list of ten linguistic expressions that are
    conceptually based in this frame. Construct four sentences that depict a single situation within this
    frame, but which vary in their profiles and construals. Are the elements in the Wedding Frame likely to be
    universal (i.e., found in all cultures across the world) or likely to vary? What about the Commercial Event
    Frame discussed in Section 7.9? Explain your position.
**11.** In the following examples, each of underlined lexemes is polysemous. State whether the polysemy is based
    on metaphor, metonymy, or both.
    **a.** _He is feeling blue._
    **b.** _The music was hot._
    **c.** _She ran the election flawlessly_.
    **d.** _The university filed a lawsuit._
    **e.** _She came to the foot of the hill_.
    **f.** _He backed into a fence._
    **g.** _She spent time getting to know him._


# 8 Pragmatics

_Inference for Language_

### CHAPTER PREVIEW

```
Semantics is a major way in which meaning is conveyed through language, but not all
meaning is tied directly to linguistic forms. Some of the meaning conveyed through language
comes from interpretations based on the broader social, cultural, and interactional contexts;
the study of such interpretations makes up the field of pragmatics. Pragmatics is what makes
natural discourse coherent and relevant. The primary role of pragmatic theories is to explain
pragmatic inferences, which are how interlocutors manage to convey much more than their
utterances explicitly encode. In producing discourse, speakers routinely provide information
that allows addressees to make pragmatic inferences. Addressees base these inferences on
contextual assumptions that come in part from the content of the speakers’ words, and in
part from extralinguistc sources. These processes are informed by some overarching pragmatic
principles, which will be discussed throughout this chapter.

You can find definitions for key
terms and bolded terms throughout
this chapter in the Glossary (at the
back of this book or on the student
resources website). Additional online
resources for this chapter include a
study guide, review quiz, vocabulary
quizzes, and an interactive quiz on
entailments and implicatures.
```
```
Maya: Aw, they always change it!
Mom: Really?
Maya: What, would I lie to you?
```
```
Maya misunderstands her mom, taking her really? to indicate
that her mom doubted her. But what is it that Maya misunder-
stands? Clearly it’s not the linguistic meaning of really? (‘is that
true?’). Rather, Maya is missing the pragmatic interpreta-
tion of really? that her mom intended: to express surprise, rather
than to question factuality. Missing this bit creates a communi-
cation break between mother and daughter.
Imagine the very same exchange, but with Maya as an adult,
who correctly interprets her mother’s really? as indicating sur-
prise. In this case, Maya’s response would be taken as joking.
Surprisingly perhaps, the source for this very different interpre-
tation of really? is exactly the same: while the young Maya is unaware of the pragmatic
interpretation of really? , the joking Maya pretends it isn’t there. This is not something she
could do if she were limited to the linguistic meaning of the expression. There is a dif-
ference between linguistic meanings (observed by both versions of Maya) and pragmatic
interpretations (unacknowledged, for different reasons, by both Mayas). Pragmatic inter-
pretations play a fundamental role in interaction and communication. What are pragmatic
interpretations? How are they derived? How can we tell a pragmatic interpretation from a
semantic one? Should we? These are questions that will be addressed in this chapter.
The field of pragmatics examines how context supports our use and interpretation
of linguistic expressions. Language is not produced in a vacuum. Linguistic forms must
routinely be connected to the interactional, physical, cultural, and social environment in
which they are produced. Linguistic behavior is grounded in a particular context , which
surrounds, informs, underlies, and shapes a linguistic event. For example, a particular con-
versation will have a physical context (where the conversation takes place), a social context
(the social relationships of the participants), a cultural context (shared knowledge about
the culture in which the participants are based), and an encyclopedic knowledge context
(specific assumptions about the world shared by speakers and addressees). A particular
utterance within a conversation will also have a discourse context, or what was said before
the utterance, prompting the speaker to make the utterance relevant and shaping the form
it takes.

Pragmatic interpretation is complicated because context contains a vast number of
assumptions. Speakers must identify just the bits of context that are relevant on a particular
occasion. Pragmatics refers to the cognitive ability to draw contextually plausible
inferences, which complement linguistic meanings. Pragmatic theories explain how
we use our inferential abilities to efficiently identify and interpret the relevant context
when communicating. This includes how we are able to infer the intended meaning of a
linguistic expression, even when that meaning is not made fully explicit. In this chapter,
we will discuss pragmatic theories, different types of pragmatic inferences, and the division
of labor between semantics and pragmatics in utterance interpretation.
```
```
8.1.1 Pragmatics as Context-Dependent Inference Drawing
When a speaker communicates with you, you perform a semantic analysis of their words.
But it is not enough to just add up the fixed meanings encoded by linguistic expressions in
a compositional manner. As we have seen in Example (1), using and interpreting language
crucially relies on something in addition to – and quite different from – the mastery of
semantics. Utterance meanings are more than the sum of their linguistic parts. The linguis-
tic system builds on a highly developed inferential system, without which linguistic inter-
actions would not be possible. This extralinguistic competence is pragmatics.
```
### STOP AND REFLECT 8.1 BROADER MEANINGS IN A PUBLIC SERVICE AD

```
To appreciate the pervasiveness of pragmatic inferences, consider the following advertisement of the
American Lung Association, which was seen on a bus in Santa Barbara, California, in February of 2002:
(2) Asthma is on the rise. Please double your efforts. Support Christmas Seals.
What do you think are the communicative goals of this ad? What information is encoded explicitly in the
semantics? What information must be “filled in” by the process of pragmatic inference? Give this some
thought before reading the following paragraphs.
```
```
Example (2) in Stop and Reflect 8.1 should have led you to consider a number of ques-
tions: What is the connection between asthma being on the rise and doubling our efforts?
Which efforts are those? Somehow we need to infer that the efforts are related to the pre-
viously mentioned asthma. Since asthma is considered undesirable, we infer that probably
what is referred to are efforts toward eliminating or reducing asthma or its effects. Having
figured this out, we immediately face another puzzling question: How is supporting an
organization called Christmas Seals relevant to fighting asthma? Once again, we need to
rely on our general knowledge (here, very much culture-dependent) and access the fact that
Christmas Seals is a charity that sells stickers used on Christmas cards, and whose profits
support fighting lung diseases. In other words, the rather short discourse in (2) is actually
interpreted as something like:
```
```
(3) Asthma is on the rise. [ Therefore ,] please double your efforts [ to fight it ]. Support Christmas
Seals [ because they fight asthma ].
```
```
Example (3) is not only clumsy; it feels redundant. Since the intended addressees
(Americans) can infer the boldfaced information easily, stating it explicitly in this manner
```

**198 Mira Ariel**

```
is unnecessary. Speakers routinely rely on addressees’ cognitive abilities to draw such ad hoc
pragmatic inferences. With the help of pragmatics, language production and processing are
made more efficient, and thus take less time and effort.
Human languages are linguistically underdetermined , that is, they can never
encode everything that we actually intend our addressees to understand as the message of
our utterances. This is why the drawing of pragmatic inferences is critical in making lan-
guage work as a communicative system. Consider again Example (3). Although it seems a
much more specific version of (2), it still does not explicitly encode every piece of intended
information. The following added interpretations (underlined) are also part of the message
contained in the advertisement in (2):
```
**(4)** _Asthma_ [ _in the US_ ] is [ _recently and projected to be in the future_ ] _on the rise_ [ _(i.e., more people now
suffer from it)_ ]. [ **Therefore** ,] _please double your efforts_ [ **to fight it** ( _and make an effort to fight
it even if you haven’t in the past_ )]. _Support Christmas Seals_ [ **because they fight Asthma** ( _and
this will constitute YOUR effort in fighting Asthma_ )].
And even (4) does not exhaust all the information that goes into interpreting (2). How
much is asthma on the rise? We infer that it is rising significantly. How should the addressee
support Christmas Seals? Presumably, by buying many Christmas Seals, which support the
organization financially (rather than morally, for example). We could enumerate more and
more hidden assumptions. There’s certainly a lot of interpretation that doesn’t meet the
semantic eye. It is up to pragmatics to provide it. But how?

8.2 **Pragmatic Theories**

```
Pragmatic interpretations are real and pervasive, but they seem to require mind reading. As
difficult as that sounds, this ‘mind reading’ is a necessary skill for linguistic communication.
Psycholinguists have demonstrated that babies develop the skill of reading communicative
intention around the age of one, and that this skill is a prerequisite for language learn-
ing. The cognitive processes that humans use to determine communicative intention and
understand the full intended meaning of utterances are the domain of pragmatic theory.
We here briefly discuss two such theories: the Gricean Conversational Maxims (Grice
1989 ) and the Principle of Relevance (Sperber and Wilson 1986/1995). Each theory helps
us understand how addressees derive the inferred interpretations
exemplified above. The basic idea is that we have certain expec-
tations for how natural discourse must proceed, e.g., it should be
coherent, relevant, etc. The task of meeting these expectations
is shared between explicit linguistic expressions and implicit
assumptions. Semantics accounts for explicit aspects, pragmatics
for implicit aspects.
```
8.2.1 The Gricean Conversational Maxims

```
Grice pointed out that discourse is a cooperative endeavor (this is his Cooperative
Principle). In order to be cooperative participants in discourse, we must abide by the fol-
lowing four maxims (referred to as Grice’s Maxims ).
```

tThe Quantity Maxim : speakers must be informative, that is, provide just enough infor-
mation, neither too much nor too little.
tThe Quality Maxim : speakers must only assert truthful and well-supported information.
tThe Relevance Maxim : speakers must be relevant.
tThe Manner Maxim : speakers must be brief, clear, nonambiguous, and orderly.
Consider the example in (5):
```
```
(5) Roy: ... It’s dark, how will we see what we’re eating.
Marilyn: ... Candles. (SBC: 003)
Note that Marilyn’s response is just informative enough: it’s
relevant and short, and we assume she’s sincere. It thus obeys
all the Gricean Maxims. Note, though, that we must still draw a
trivial inference, that the candles will be lit, if the interlocutors
are to see what they’re eating. In other words, in order to see
Marilyn’s response as abiding by Relevance, we need to add to
her explicit message (candles) an implicit assumption (they will
be lit).
Inferences such as these, as well as those specified for (2)
above and others below, are called particularized conversa-
tional implicatures by Grice (henceforth, implicatures ).
Implicatures are inferences: the speaker intends the addressee
to infer them based on a set of contextually available assump-
tions. Implicatures can be contrasted with logical inferences (or
entailments). To see the difference between entailments and
implicatures, consider (6):
```
```
(6) a. He kissed her on the neck.
b. He kissed her.
```
```
In a plea bargain case negotiated in Israel in June of 2007, the defendant’s lawyers got the
prosecutor to charge him with (b) rather than with (a), although (a) is a faithful description
of what happened. Now, of course if ‘x kissed y on the neck’ then ‘x must have kissed y’: (a)
entails (b) because if (a) is true, so must (b) be true. Note that the opposite does not hold
necessarily. (b) does not entail (a), because he may have kissed her on the cheek, in which
case it’s true that he kissed her, but it’s not true that he kissed her on the neck. Now, why did
the lawyers prefer the charge in (b) over (a)? Because of what (a), but not (b) implicates ,
namely that the kiss was of a sexual nature. Note that this is not a necessary conclusion,
though. Perhaps he intended to give her a fatherly kiss on her cheek, but she moved and the
kiss accidentally ended up being on the neck, although no sexual intentions were involved.
So an important difference between implicatures and entailments is that whereas entail-
ments are logically necessary inferences, implicatures are not; they are only plau-
sible. Thus, if (a) is true, then he necessarily kissed her (an entailment), but it’s plausible
but not necessarily true that the kiss was a sexual act (the implicature).

Notice that Rebecca does not explicitly say “yes” (the most informative answer in terms of
Quantity). Instead, she provides the evidence she has for an affirmative answer, not want-
ing to commit to that which she is not sure of. By presenting just the evidence, she lets
June infer the likelihood of the man taking the stand. Rebecca violates Quantity, but obeys
Quality. The implicatures are: ‘maybe he will take the stand’; ‘Rebecca is not in a position to
know for sure.’ They are based on the flouting of Quantity, which Rebecca cannot observe.
Grice’s most intriguing observation is that we sometimes fail to follow one of the
maxims not because we can’t, but because we choose not to. Speakers might choose
to violate one of the maxims in order to generate an implicature. Let’s examine a few
examples:
```
```
The set of inferences can be divided into two classes: entailments (inferences that speakers
make based on logical reasoning) and implicatures (inferences that are plausible but do not
necessarily follow), as diagrammed in Figure 8.1.
```
**(7)** (^) June: _Is he gonna take the stand?_
Rebecca: (H) _He says so_ (SBC: 008).

### STOP AND REFLECT 8.2 LOGICAL VERSUS PRAGMATIC INFERENCES

```
For each of the following statements, determine whether they constitute a logical inference (entailment) or
a pragmatic inference (implicature) based on the sentence John drove his car to the farmer’s market Saturday.
You can find the answers on the HLW website.
a. John shopped at the farmer’s market Saturday.
b. John was at or near the farmer’s market on Saturday.
c. John owns a car.
d. John can drive.
```
```
Now, we’ve seen that implicatures were needed in (5), even though Marilyn observed the
Gricean Maxims. On other occasions, we cannot follow all of Grice’s Maxims, because they
happen to clash. This is another impetus for implicature generation. Suppose someone asks
you a question. The Quantity Maxim prompts you to supply a fully informative answer. But
what if you can’t, because you don’t have all the relevant information, or because you’re
not sure? Observing Quality (truthfulness) forbids you to say something false or unreliable.
Look what Rebecca does under such circumstances (Rebecca is a prosecutor and he is a
defendant in a court case):
```

**201 8 Pragmatics**

```

person of eighty CONJ=nine.
‘I heard the different versions (testimonies) of an 89-year-old person.’

```

‘Did you get tired, Clara?’
```
```
Clara:

‘Not too much.’
```
```
Gym teacher:
```
```
e. J: How is your tomato?
M: It’s little ripe.
J: Yeah, had to edit it.
Examples (8a)–(8e) each manifest some maxim violation. Since the speakers are nonetheless
seen as cooperative, they are taken to have intentionally violated the maxims in order to
generate a variety of implicatures. Consider (8a), which refers to the testimony of a person
in a court of law. Is the age of a witness relevant? Not in most cases. But here the speaker is
trying to tell us more than ‘I heard the different versions (testimonies) of a person,’ which
```
```

‘So, a little in other words.’
c. Hebrew

M exist to.2SG.F dog.F sick.F at.DEF=home
‘M, you have a sick dog at home!’
```

**202 Mira Ariel**

```
would have been informative enough under the circumstances. In specifying the age of the
person, the speaker provides too much information (contra the Quantity Maxim), thereby
implicating that an 89-year-old person, who provides different versions of testimony about
some event, is ‘not trustworthy.’ This inference is plausible, but does not follow necessarily;
therefore it is a particularized conversational implicature.
Now consider Example (8b). Here, too, Quantity is breached, but in a different way. Clara’s
response is not informative enough. To say that she ‘did not get awfully tired’ doesn’t say any-
thing about how tired she did get. Logically, it even leaves open the possibility that she did not
get tired at all (‘I didn’t get awfully tired; I didn’t even get a little tired’). In the context of the utter-
ance, however, the speaker generates the implicature that the teacher spells out in the next turn.
In (8c) we have a breach of Quality. A woman who has a grandchild is by definition a
grandmother. Obviously, the speaker is therefore a grandmother. Denying this fact appears
to be untruthful, and the sentence seems inherently contradictory. Implicatures are crucial
for understanding this, as usual: the speaker, though a grandmother, feels and acts like a
young woman. By denying that she is a grandmother, she is implicating a rejection of the
(old) image of a grandmother.
Example (8d), which illustrates a violation of Relation, was uttered at a faculty meeting in
which the chair, M, had announced that the meeting should be as brief as possible because
she had a sick dog to attend to. When M herself seemed to go off topic and cause the meet-
ing to drag on, her colleague produced the utterance in (8d). Although this utterance was
irrelevant with respect to the department business being discussed, the intended implica-
ture was, ‘stick to the agenda!’
Finally, (8e) shows a Manner violation. It’s not immediately clear what it would mean to
edit a tomato. A speaker abiding by Manner would have used more conventional means to
express the same meaning (by saying, for example, cut out parts of it ). But J chooses an inno-
vative (metaphorical) combination, playfully implicating a similarity between language
editing and cutting a tomato.
In all of these cases, the speaker’s blatant violation of some maxim is intended to
generate a particularized conversational implicature. What is the status of these impli-
catures? Why don’t the speakers express what they mean explicitly? (e.g., “I’m not old”;
“Cutting a tomato is like editing a paper”). We have mentioned efficiency in connection
with the inferences in (2), and the same applies to (5). But
efficiency doesn’t seem to be the motivation in the examples
in (8). The speakers in (8) aim to make use of the special cog-
nitive and discoursal status of pragmatic inferences.
An important difference between semantic meanings and
implicatures is that implicatures are external to the linguistic
meaning : the proposition explicitly expressed and the implicature generated have separate
contents and separate conditions under which they are true. The truth or falsehood of the
explicit message of I heard the different versions (testimonies) of an eighty-nine-year-old person is
independent of the plausibility of the implicature that ‘an eighty-nine-year-old person is not
reliable.’ Because of this, implicatures do not affect the truth conditions of the proposition
that triggers them. This is why, unlike entailments, implicatures are cancelable. Consider
Example (9), taken from a bumper sticker:
```
### SIDEBAR 8.5

```
For an introduction to propositions ,
see Section 7.4.
```

**203 8 Pragmatics**

```
(9) I don’t suffer from insanity.
I enjoy every minute of it.
Based on the first sentence in (9), the reader would reason that the author of these words is
implicating that he or she is mentally healthy; however, the second utterance cancels this
interpretation, rendering the implicature (that the author is mentally healthy) implausible.
This is what it means for implicatures to be cancelable. Contrast (9) with the constructed
variant in (10). Here the second sentence denies the explicit meaning (‘not suffering from
insanity’) and the result is an irresolvable contradiction.
```
```
(10) ?? I don’t suffer from insanity. I suffer from insanity.
Cancelability is one of the ways that semantic meanings and implicatures differ. Only
implicatures are cancelable.
Another way in which implicatures differ from explicit semantic meanings is that
implicatures are only indirectly communicated. They are not conventionally
and invariably tied to specific linguistic expressions, for they are context-dependent.
Compare the use of really in (11a) to that in Example (1), here repeated as (11b).
```
```
(11) a. A: Because nobody’s used to rain, it’s like schools close.
B: Really?
A: Well, I mean, I’m exaggerating here. (LSAC: 1118–01)
b. Maya: Aw, they always change it!
Mom: Really?
Maya: What, would I lie to you?
Unlike in (11b), Really? is used in (11a) to explicitly question the truthfulness of A’s utter-
ance. Since the same expression ( really? ) is involved in (11a) and (11b), it must be the dif-
ferent context which is responsible for the occurrence or nonoccurrence of the implicature.
We have seen that Grice’s Maxims set up norms, which account for discourse coherence
and which guide interlocutors in making pragmatic interpretations. We next review an alter-
native theory for discourse coherence, and therefore also for how pragmatic interpretations
are made.
```
```
8.2.2 The Principle of Relevance
Sperber and Wilson (1986/1995), in revising Grice’s Maxims, have proposed to replace
Quantity, Relation, and Manner with a single cognitive principle: The Principle of
Relevance. (They also dropped the Quality Maxim altogether.) They argue that people
are automatically geared toward searching for maximally relevant information, and that
linguistic acts specifically come with a presumption of relevance.
For an utterance to be Sperber-Wilson Relevant , it must achieve some cognitive effects.
Simply put, it must (attempt to) induce some change in the addressee’s cognitive state (e.g.,
by adding or eliminating assumptions that the addressee holds). However, not every change
is Relevant. Imagine that Maya addressed her first utterance in (1) to you, rather than to
her mother. Her assertion that ‘they always change it’ would constitute new knowledge for
you. This would no doubt change your cognitive state, but this utterance is just not relevant
```

**204 Mira Ariel**

```
enough because we are not told who they are, what it is, and why all this matters. For
Relevance Theory to account for how natural discourse proceeds, it must define “Relevant
cognitive effects” more narrowly:
```
```
tRelevant cognitive effects must be contextual implications, i.e., inferences made based on
(1) the content of the utterance combined with (2) available contextual assumptions.
tThere must be a sufficient number of contextual implications (in order for these implica-
tions to have a Relevant cognitive effect).
tDeriving the cognitive effects (i.e., making the inferences) must involve the most minimal
processing effort.
```
```
Let’s take these three conditions one by one. First, for an utterance to constitute a Relevant
contribution, it must combine with contextual assumptions to yield further contextual
implications. Such contextual assumptions may have been mentioned in the preceding dis-
course, or they may have to be accessed from our encyclopedic knowledge (see Figure 8.2).
Now, the reason why Maya’s utterance in (1) couldn’t be Relevant to you is that it’s hard
to imagine what contextual assumptions you could bring to bear on that proposition, such
that together with the content, they would yield some implications. You and Maya do not
share sufficient context to enable this. Since no contextual assumptions can be drawn here,
the utterance is not Relevant (for you) in the Sperber–Wilson sense.
Let’s contrast this with the American Lung Association ad in Example (2). In that case, we
can combine the explicit proposition ( asthma is on the rise ) with a background assumption
(from our general knowledge) that ‘asthma is dangerous,’ to yield contextual implications
such as ‘It is alarming that asthma is on the rise’; and ‘We should do something to fight
asthma.’ Since the combination of the content of (2) with contextual assumptions yields
contextual implications, the utterance is Relevant. This definition then accounts for our
intuitive feeling that relevance entails some connection between an utterance and its con-
text. This is shown in the diagram in Figure 8.2.
Second, regarding the number of contextual implications, the more contextual impli-
cations there are, the higher the Relevance of the utterance. Comparing (6a) and (6b),
the former ( He kissed her on the neck ) is more Relevant, for it gives rise to an additional con-
textual implication that (6b) doesn’t, namely that the kiss was sexual. This requirement,
however, specifies only that there be a sufficient number of contextual implications, so (6b)
may very well be Relevant enough in many contexts.
Third, regarding processing effort, pretend now that (2) appeared on a bus in Warsaw.
Relevance Theory offers an explanation for why the same discourse might not be Relevant/
```
```

```
```

```
```

```

**205 8 Pragmatics**

```
appropriate when in a different context. Cultural differences translate to different contex-
tual assumptions. Polish readers would be able to process the first two sentences, but they
would be baffled by the third. Unlike most American addressees, who can easily access
the necessary contextual assumptions immediately, non-Americans, who do not know
what Christmas Seals are, would have to improvise. They might (correctly) assume that
Christmas Seals is an organization that fights asthma. But relying on the Polish addressee
to come up with such a culturally foreign contextual assumption as a premise for some
conclusion is risky. While speakers do sometimes force addressees to generate contextual
assumptions they cannot retrieve from their general knowledge store, such processes
are bound to slow the addressee down. This is why Sperber and Wilson’s definition of
Relevance discourages such uses.
The inappropriateness of the asthma ad in Warsaw is accounted for by defining Relevance
as requiring the speaker to balance between contextual effects and processing costs.
Although all other things being equal, the more contextual effects, the more Relevant an
utterance is, at the same time, the harder it is to derive some contextual implication, the
less Relevant that interpretation is. In other words, although we can always add more and
more contextual assumptions in order to derive more and more contextual implications,
Optimal Relevance requires a balance between contextual effects and processing effort.
Some contextual assumptions are not easily accessible to us. Others are highly accessible.
An utterance that depends on the retrieval of highly accessible assumptions requires less
effort. Relevance Theory specifies that the effort required of the addressee be minimal:
for an utterance to be Optimally Relevant, a sufficient number of contextual implications
must be derivable by the addressee, and at a minimal processing effort (see Figure 8.3).
The asthma ad on a Warsaw bus would not be Optimally Relevant, because the processing
effort would not be as minimal as it could have been (had another sentence explained what
Christmas Seals was).
Next consider Example (12).
```
```
(12) Jamie: Aren’t you guys gonna stick up for me?
and beat up on him or something?
Miles: He’s bigger than I am. (SBC: 002)
```
```
When Jamie is (jokingly) asking her friends to beat up on her husband, Miles’s relevant
response (the contextual implication from his actual utterance) is that ‘he won’t beat up
on the husband.’ The interlocutors can reach this conclusion based on an easily accessible
contextual assumption, ‘it’s not advisable to try to beat up on a guy who’s bigger than you,
because most likely you’ll be beaten badly.’ This contextual assumption is much easier to
retrieve – so requires less processing effort – than the assumption that Christmas Seals is an
organization that fights asthma (for the Polish addressee).
In sum, both the Principle of Relevance and the Conversational Maxims explain what
makes discourse appropriate and coherent. There is an intimate connection between dis-
course appropriateness , the accessing of contextual assumptions , and pragmatic
inferences. Both theories account for the central role of pragmatic inferencing in com-
munication. The total take-home message of some utterance is its conveyed meaning ,
```

**206 Mira Ariel**

```
a combination of the semantic meaning and the pragmatic inferences intended by the
speaker (see Figure 8.4).
```
8.2.3 Different Pragmatic Interpretations for Different Purposes

```
So far we have only assumed a distinction between semantic meanings and pragmatic
meanings (implicatures). But pragmatic meanings are not all of one stripe. Consider again
Maya’s first utterance in Example (1):
```
**(1)** Maya: _Aw, they always change it!_

```
What is it , and who are they? As outsiders we do not know. In order to determine the
explicit message that Maya is communicating, her mother must infer the referents of these
pronouns (based on shared contextual assumptions). Pragmatic inferences are often
required to determine even the explicit message of an utterance , and not just the
indirect implicatures intended by the speaker. The underdetermined linguistic meaning
must often be developed by pragmatic inferences to make it a complete proposition, suffi-
ciently specific and understandable.
The linguistic code enriched by such pragmatic inferences is called (by Sperber and
Wilson 1986/1995) the explicature. The pragmatic inferences involved in understand-
ing the explicature are then explicated inferences. We can illustrate the relationship of
semantic meaning, explicated inferences, and the explicature as in Figure 8.5.

```
Maya’s first utterance in (1) is not the only case where an explicit message is incomplete
by itself. On the asthma ad in (2) the linguistic expression Double your efforts makes no sense
if one limits oneself to the semantic meaning alone. Double your efforts for what? Given
the contextual assumptions that are salient here, we can derive an explicated inference that
the efforts are aimed at fighting asthma. The addressee thus derives the explicature ‘Double
your efforts to fight asthma,’ by combining the linguistic meaning with the explicated
inference (see Figure 8.6). Without the added inferred information, the utterance would be
conceptually incomplete. Unlike Grice, who considers practically any pragmatic inference
to be an implicature, Sperber and Wilson distinguish between implicatures and explicated
inferences.
Pragmatics has a far-reaching role in human communication, far more than first envi-
sioned: it is not as if linguistic expressions always provide the main message while prag-
matic inferences provide only additional implicit and secondary interpretations, as in, e.g.,
(8). Rather, some pragmatic inferences (explicated ones) are an inherent part of the explicit
message intended by the speaker. This is the case for double your efforts in (2).
According to Relevance Theory, it is the explicature (rather than purely the semantic
meaning) that combines with contextual assumptions to yield implicatures. In inter-
actional terms, it is the explicature that counts as the directly relevant contri-
bution (rather than the incomplete linguistic meaning). To see that this is the case,
consider (13):
```
```
(13) 1 J: We can walk to Erez ,
2 and have breakfast there.
3 M: But we’re having lunch at my parents’ ,
4 and we’re going out with R tonight.
((LINES OMITTED))
5 J: Okay ,
6 We’ll have breakfast another day.
7 M: Maybe tomorrow.
Note that when J suggests that they have breakfast another day (line 6), he doesn’t mean
only that, because it’s too trivial: J and M have breakfast every morning. Rather, the
explicature from J is ‘We’ll have breakfast at Erez [Cafe] another day.’ The same applies
to M in line 7. Without the additional explicated inference, neither line 6 nor 7 makes
any sense. The whole point is whether J and M should eat out that morning. Figure 8.7
shows the complex model we have arrived at, as applied to (13).
```

All the pragmatic inferences we have considered are speaker-intended, context- dependent,
plausible, and cancelable. But whereas implicatures are indirect and external to the speak-
er’s explicit message (the explicature), explicated inferences are part and parcel of it. This is
why (14a), rather than (14b), is a faithful report on J’s utterance in (13):
```

```
(14) a. J said that they will have breakfast at Erez another day.
b. (i) J said that they will have breakfast another day , and (ii) in addition he indirectly
suggested that it would be at Erez.
```
```
The point is that J did not convey two separate messages (as represented in (14b)). J had
absolutely no intention of stating that they will have breakfast another day, for that is too
trivial a proposition. Rather, he made a single suggestion (as represented by (14a)), although
part of it was left implicit. Regardless of their different discourse statuses, all pragmatic
inferences are crucial to natural discourse.
```
8.3 **Semantics versus Pragmatics**

```
We have so far treated the semantics/pragmatics division of labor as self-evident. Indeed,
semantics analyzes conventional, context-invariant meanings, whereas pragmatics accounts
for plausible context-dependent inferences. The implicatures we have reviewed here, in
particular, are clearly pragmatic. But not all interpretations are readily classifiable as either
semantic or pragmatic. It is sometimes difficult to judge whether a given interpretation is
the conventional meaning of some form or its pragmatically inferred interpretation.
For example, I have treated ‘questioning factuality’ as the semantic meaning of really?
and ‘expressing surprise’ as a speaker implicature, which is intended in some but not all
contexts. But isn’t it possible that really? is semantically ambiguous between ‘questioning
factuality’ (its compositional meaning) and ‘expressing surprise’ (seen as a non-composi-
tional encoded meaning)? Note that the ‘surprise’ interpretation of really? is reasonably
inferred from ‘questioning factuality,’ as one may question the factuality of some propo-
sition just because it seems surprising. But the fact that some interpretation is in principle
inferable does not mean that it is actually inferred. Interpretations associated with certain
expressions may undergo a change from having a pragmatic status, where the meaning is
contextually inferred, to having a semantic status, where the meaning is conventionally
encoded. This well-known process, leading to a change from pragmatic status to seman-
tic status, is called semanticization , and it has been documented for many expressions.
Once some inference (e.g., ‘surprise’) is frequently derived whenever some specific form
(e.g., really? ) is used, the form–function association may become automatic and conven-
tionally encoded through semanticization.
Many of our current semantic meanings are actually the
result of ongoing historical processes of the semanticiza-
tion of pragmatic inferences (Textbox 8.1 provides one such
example). Therefore, we should expect to find cases where the
ongoing process of semanticization is underway, making it hard
to determine whether some interpretation is semantically coded
or (still) only pragmatically inferred.
Such cases do not mean that the semantics/pragmatics division of labor is useless. The
great majority of linguistic expressions have fixed semantic meanings, which are pragmati-
cally adapted or enriched in specific contexts, but with no long-term effects on their seman-
tic meanings. Consider again the examples in (8). Obviously, we would not want to lump

the semantic meanings of the different versions (testimonies) of an eighty-nine-year-old person,
you have a sick dog at home! , and edit a tomato with the pragmatic contextual interpretations
they give rise to here (‘unreliable,’ ‘stick to the agenda,’ and ‘cut out parts of a tomato,’
respectively). On the one hand, ad hoc pragmatic inferences are so numerous and con-
text-dependent that it would be pointless to list them as semantic meanings. On the other
hand, we need relatively fixed semantic meanings as a basis for constructing specific con-
textual pragmatic interpretations. Semantic and pragmatic interpretations are both impor-
tant, although they serve different functions in language.
```
### TEXTBOX 8.1 THE SEMANTICIZATION OF A PRAGMATIC INFERENCE

```
The English word since is a clear example of an
expression for which the semanticization of a pragmatic
inference has been completed. Originally, since had
only a temporal meaning. But in addition to this
temporal meaning, speakers using since must have
frequently generated causal implicatures, which
indirectly conveyed a causal relation between events.
Observe the following use of the very similar variant
ever since :
```
```
PATRICK: ... Well ever since he heard that I was
having problems with my band ,
you know ,
he’s been calling me a lot more. (SBC: 045)
While ever since encodes only a temporal relation
between he heard and he’s been calling. Patrick
```
```
here generates an implicature that it is because ‘he
heard’ that ‘he’s been calling ... ’ A frequent use
of since in similar contexts must have paved the
way for the semanticization of the causal inference
for since , so much so, that even in the absence of
a temporal connection, a causal interpretation is
available:
```
```
KATHY: ... Since you have the square root of two on
the bottom ,
... to make that a square ,
you have to multiply by the square root of
two. (SBC: 009)
The semanticization of since that allows it to be used in
this context has not occurred for ever since. Note that
ever since cannot replace since here.
```
### CHAPTER SUMMARY

```
We have defined pragmatic interpretations as complementary to semantic interpretations.
While semantic meanings are context-invariant encoded meanings specified for
particular linguistic expressions, pragmatic meanings are nonconventional plausible
inferences , triggered by linguistic expressions only when used in supportive contexts.
This is why only pragmatic interpretations are cancelable. We presented two proposals
(Grice’s Maxims and the Principle of Relevance) that account for the derivation of speaker-
intended pragmatic inferences. While differing on many points, both of the approaches
view utterance meanings as routinely combining semantic and pragmatic meanings. We
further distinguished between types of pragmatic inferences, based on their cognitive and
discoursal statuses. Particularized conversational implicatures are external to semantic
meanings and indirectly conveyed, while explicated inferences are integrated into the
semantic meaning to create a single proposition, the explicature.
```

**211 8 Pragmatics**

```
We revisited the semantics/pragmatics question in the end, proposing that although
pragmatics is very often the source of our current semantic meanings, for the most part,
semantic and pragmatic meanings are kept apart. All in all, we cannot overestimate the
important role pragmatics plays in interpreting language:
```
```
Pragmatics accounts for discourse appropriateness (relevance, coherence)
Pragmatics participates in fleshing out the speaker’s explicit message (explicature)
Pragmatics explains how indirect additional messages (implicatures) are derived
Pragmatics provides raw materials for our future grammar (semanticization of pragmatic
interpretations)

### EXERCISES

**1.** Consider the following utterance and determine whether (a) and (b) below are entailed or implicated.
    Explain your answers.
    ROY: _and they probably didn’t have to wash their salads back then_ ,
       _because they didn’t know what was on them._ (SBC: 003: 165.80–169.73)
    **a.** ‘They ate salads back then’ is:
       **i.** An entailment
       **ii.** An implicature
    **b.** ‘They didn’t have the scientific resources to know what was on their salads back then’ is:
       **i.** An entailment
       **ii.** An implicature
**2.** Consider the following exchange about some fish, and identify the implicatures involved:

```
MARILYN (i): .. It’s kind of smelly ,
isn’t it.
PETE: Mhm.
MARILYN (ii): But I got it at a reputable market. (SBC: 003: 22.84–28.20)
In each of her turns Marilyn generates (at least) two implicatures. For each of the potential pair of implica-
tures stated below, state whether they are the ‘correct’ implicatures generated by Marilyn or not (‘incorrect’).
For incorrect answers, state why they are incorrect.
a. (i) Possibly the fish is spoiled; (ii) Possibly I paid a high price for the fish.
b. (i) We mustn’t eat the fish; (ii) Let’s eat the fish.
c. (i) Possibly the fish is spoiled; (ii) Probably the fish is not spoiled.
```
**3.** Here are two cases where speakers might seem to contradict themselves. How would you resolve this
    contradiction? ( _Hint_ : Construct the relevant explicatures.)
    **a.** _I was a composer even before I was a composer and my teacher, composer Abel Erlich, knew it right from_
       _the start._ (Originally Hebrew, _Haaretz_ , July 27, 2007)
    **b.** _At any rate, at this point the arrival in Israel_ [of the Ethiopian Jews – M.A.] _is perceived as incomplete,_
       _as one of the interviewees put it: “We’ve arrived, but we haven’t arrived.”_ (Originally Hebrew, _Haaretz_ ,
       November 9, 2007)
**4.** J must have misunderstood M’s _D’you know what time it is_? in the following exchange (note that J’s utterance
    is not _What?_ , which would indicate that he did not hear the question and is requesting that she repeat it):
    M: _D’you know what time it is?_
    J: _What._
    M: _No, do you know what time it is?_
    Explain the source of the miscommunication here. Is it the same as in Example (1) at the beginning of this
    chapter? ( _Hint:_ No.)

**5.** Consider again the following exchange and analyze it according to Grice:
    J: _We can walk to Erez,_
       _and have breakfast there._
    M: _But we’re having lunch at my parents’,_
       _and we’re going out with R tonight._
    **i.** Indicate which of Grice’s Maxims is violated by M.
    **ii.** Which of the following implicatures is thereby generated?
       **a.** ‘It’s not a good idea to eat out three times a day’.
       **b.** ‘We should skip breakfast because we’re eating lunch and dinner today’.
       **c.** ‘We shouldn’t eat at Erez, because it’s too much trouble to walk there’.
**6.** Using the concepts of particularized conversational implicature, as well as cancellation, can you explain
    why A’s _That’s my job_ below resembles a punchline in a joke?
       ((The addressee has been very carefully folding up some scotch tape around a picture, so that it
       won’t stick to the wall and damage it))
    A: _You don’t have to be such a perfectionist._
       ((Pause))
       _That’s MY job_.
**7.** Consider again the following exchange and analyze it according to Sperber and Wilson’s concept of
    contextual assumptions:
    JUNE: _Is he gonna take the stand?_
    REBECCA: (H) **He says so**. (SBC: 008: 1420.32–1422.92)
    **i.** What contextual assumption must June access if she infers a positive answer to her question?
       **a.** Something like: ‘If someone says they will do something, then most probably they will.’
       **b.** Something like: ‘Defendants tend to want to testify’; ‘He is a defendant.’
    **ii.** What contextual assumption might lead June to doubt that a positive answer was intended by Rebecca?
       **a.** Something like: ‘The defendant will not take the stand.’.
       **b.** Something like: ‘The defendant is not a reliable person. Therefore, the fact that he says that he will
          do something does not at all mean he will actually do it.’
**8.** Consider Fran’s utterances, paying special attention to the **underlined** expressions, and determine whether
    their interpretations, provided below, are implicated or explicated:
    FRAN: _and this is a guy_ **like seventy years old, or something**
       _he’d been_ **driving a cab for forty years** _, and_ **proud of it**. (SBC: 051)
_Like seventy years old, or something_ > ‘About seventy years old’
_driving a cab for forty years_ > ‘driving noncontinuously, whenever he worked’, i.e., ‘he’d worked as a cab
driver for forty years’
_proud of it_ > ‘proud of being a cab driver’ (not of the cab)
    Here are some questions that might help you decide:
    What if you find out the guy is 50? Or that he drove a cab but not for a living, or that he drove it day and
    night for 40 years? Or that he was proud of his cab?
**9.** Consider the following utterance and analyze Marilyn’s explicature. Marilyn is preparing dinner with two
    friends:
    MARILYN: _well_ ,
       _.. we could’ve gone out_ ,
       _but_ ,
       _I wanted it to be homemade_ (SBC: 003: 241.41–244.33)


**214 Mira Ariel**

```
i. Which of the following accurately spells out the explicature intended by Marilyn?
a. We could have gone out to eat at a restaurant, but I wanted the food to be homemade.
b. We could have gone out to eat at a restaurant, but I wanted the food to be homemade, so that’s
why we’re cooking at home.
c. We didn’t go out because homemade food is better.
ii. What linguistic cue do we get from Marilyn that we need to enrich her statement we could’ve gone out
with ‘to eat at a restaurant’ as part of the explicature?
a. Go out requires that we specify a goal for the act of ‘going out’.
b. But requires some contrast between the two conjuncts it conjoins. ‘Going out’ does not contrast
with ‘wanting the food to be homemade’. But ‘going out to eat at a restaurant’ does.
```
**10.** Consider a few examples with _at the same time_ and with _while_. Both are sometimes understood to refer
    to events or situations that stand in contrast to each other. Based on the following data, what can we say
    about the semantic or pragmatic status of ‘contrast’ for _while_ and _at the same time_? Has it semanticized
    into an encoded meaning, or is it only pragmatically inferred in some but not all contexts? Is this status
    the same for the two expressions? One useful method is to try to exchange the two expressions with each
    other as well as with _when_ , which has roughly the same temporal meaning. Since we’re only interested
    in meaning, you should make syntactic changes as necessary, and then check whether the variants you
    created are still synonymous. Specifically, check whether the variants convey some contrast, and whether
    they still convey temporal simultaneity.
       (Hints: The less the presence of a contrast interpretation in some variant, the less contrast has
       semanticized. The less the presence of a temporal interpretation in some variant, the more likely
       the semanticization of ‘contrast’ has progressed, to the point that it has started ousting the original
       temporal linguistic meaning.)
       Note that the goal here is not to reach a definitive answer regarding these expressions. Rather, it is to
       try to construct arguments for a semantic versus pragmatic status.

# 9 Discourse

_Language beyond the Sentence_

### CHAPTER PREVIEW

```
In the preceding chapters, we looked at linguistic units such as the phoneme, morpheme,
phrase, and sentence. Discourse, as described here, is the study of language at levels beyond
the sentence, how larger stretches of language are organized, and ways in which this
organization influences the shapes of sentences and words. This chapter will particularly focus
on the discourse genre of spoken conversation. It will introduce students to conventions
for the transcription of conversational speech, and in particular, prosodic features such as
intonation. The chapter will look at differences between prosodic and syntactic structuring
and how speakers use intonation units to manage discourse goals such as navigating topics
of conversation or structuring narratives. It will also introduce the notion of information
structure and the concepts of given, new, and accessible information, and will look at how
the identifiability of referents is marked in English grammar. At multiple points throughout the
discussion, the chapter will illustrate that grammatical structures are employed for discourse
purposes.

9.1 **Introduction**

```
The term “discourse” is used in a variety of ways. It may, for example, refer to an estab-
lished way of talking about something, as with “medical discourse” or “feminist discourse.”
Within linguistics most discourse studies fall into one of two broad categories: investigating
ways in which language is used and investigating larger levels
of language structure. It is this latter use of the term that is dis-
cussed here.
It is easiest to understand basic concepts of discourse through
examples in one’s own language, without the complicating fac-
tors of unfamiliar grammatical devices, and with the ability to
reflect on one’s own discourse practices. For that reason, all of
the examples discussed in this chapter are taken from English.
Nevertheless, most of what is said in this chapter is true of all
spoken languages; only the language-particular details of pros-
ody and grammar differ. Discourse functions are the same
across languages because all humans have the same cog-
nitive structures and the same communicative needs in speaking.
```
9.2 **Hierarchies of Linguistic Units**

```
In the field of linguistics, there has been a tendency over the years to work gradually
upward from smaller units to larger ones. During the period that preceded and immediately
followed World War II, much attention was paid to the phoneme, a unit of sound that was
regarded as the minimal unit of language. There was also a lively concern for morphology,
the structure of words, which were thought to be composed of morphemes, which in turn
were composed of phonemes. For example, the word hunted was analyzed as a sequence of
two morphemes, hunt and - ed , and each of these morphemes was analyzed as a sequence of
phonemes. Around 1960, a great deal of work and effort began to be devoted to syntax, the
structure of sentences, which were in turn composed of words. Thus, language at that time
was thought to possess a hierarchical structure like this:
```
### SIDEBAR 9.1

terms and bolded terms throughout
this chapter in the Glossary (at the
back of this book or on the student
resources website). Additional online
resources for this chapter include a

quizzes, and accompanying audio
files.
```

**217 9 Discourse**

```
sentences
are composed of words
are composed of morphemes
are composed of phonemes.
Beginning around the 1970s, significant attention began to be extended to ways in which
sentences combine within still larger stretches of language. Language beyond the sentence
has been called discourse , and thus a new level was added to the hierarchy:
discourse
is composed of sentences
are composed of words
are composed of morphemes
are composed of phonemes.
Discourse studies have led to important revisions in the ways linguists approach language
as a whole. For example, whereas linguists earlier felt free to invent their own examples of
isolated words or sentences, it was impossible to invent larger stretches of language in the
same way. Inventing conversations is best left to writers of fiction. Discourse studies have
thus necessarily emphasized the importance of recording language as it is actually used
under natural circumstances. Furthermore , discourse cannot be expected to conform to
patterns as clearly defined as those found in morphology or syntax. The ways peo-
ple create larger stretches of language are governed by their purposes and the flow of their
thoughts, and those processes are not as rigidly structured as words or sentences. In spite
of this looser organization, discourse analysts have discovered a variety of ways in which
larger stretches of language are organized, and also ways in which discourse factors influ-
ence the shape of sentences and words.
```
```
9.3 Genres of Discourse
Discourse studies have also highlighted the fact that language comes in many varieties, or
genres. One obvious distinction separates spoken language from written language. Speaking
and writing are very different ways of producing and comprehending language, and these
differences can lead to significant changes in the language itself.
There are many other genres within spoken and written discourse. For example, spoken
language is found in conversations, stories, interviews, speeches, service encounters, and so
on. Written language is found in letters, fictional and nonfictional books and articles, news
reports, editorials, and email and text messages. Each of the many ways language is used
follows discourse patterns that are shaped by the needs of that use.
Within these varieties, spoken conversations enjoy a special status. Early on in
human history, people were probably speaking with each other before they developed other
ways of using language. People converse often and naturally and with no special training,
whereas other uses of language need to be deliberately taught and learned. Written lan-

world’s population remained illiterate. Because of its priority in these respects, the focus in
this chapter will be on spoken conversational discourse.
In one respect analyzing written language is an easier task, because writing has a perma-
nence that allows it to be revisited and analyzed at one’s leisure. Spoken language is realized
in transient sounds that disappear almost as soon as they are produced. Modern technol-
ogy has given us the advantage of allowing these evanescent sounds to be preserved and
replayed, greatly improving our ability to analyze speech as it actually occurs. Nevertheless,
linguists nearly always begin their analyses by transcribing speech into a written form that
they can peruse whenever and however they wish. These transcriptions have their limita-
tions and can never capture everything that is present in the sounds themselves. Thus, their
form and content is always determined by the goals of the investigator and by whatever
conventions those goals may dictate.
```
```
STOP AND REFLECT: 9.1 THE IMPORTANCE OF LISTENING Sound file (1)
Transcriptions of spoken language, even when marking prosodic features such as intonation and loudness,
never do justice to the richness of the spoken voice. Try reading Example (1), then listen to the sound file
on the website. You’ll notice an immediate deepening in your understanding of the conversation and the
interaction in which it takes place.
Listening repeatedly, while working though the transcript, is a good habit that will reward you with insights
at increasingly fine levels of detail.
```
9.4 **Transcribing Conversational Speech**

```
Example (1) is an excerpt from a conversation between a mother and daughter. The
sequences of two and three dots show shorter and longer pauses. The square brackets show
overlapping speech, as in line 7, where the mother’s words but I thought overlapped with the
daughter’s words and then he in line 6. The accent marks show words or syllables that were
given special prominence with higher pitch, often with louder volume, and sometimes
with lengthening. (See Stop and Reflect 9.1 for a note on the limitations of transcripts such
as this one and the importance of listening, and Textbox 9.1 for a note on how discourse
data can be compiled into searchable corpora.)

**219 9 Discourse**

### TEXTBOX 9.1 DISCOURSE CORPORA

```
Data for spoken discourse typically consist of a set of
recordings, accompanied by transcriptions that may
be annotated in various ways. The recordings and
annotations together are combined into a corpus
(plural corpora ) that can be analyzed using a variety
of methodologies. The study of discourse benefits from
detailed qualitative analyses, of the type introduced
here, as well as from quantitative methodologies that
reveal patterns over large data sets.
There are a number of publicly available corpora
that have been converted into online searchable
databases, such as the Corpus of Contemporary
American English, the British National Corpus,
and El Corpus del Español. These can be used in a
variety of ways. For example, a concordance of all
of the examples of the word well in the Corpus of
Contemporary American English produces a list of
648,485 examples of well in the context in which
```
```
they occurred, including the ten examples below
(all from television news shows). One can use this
to analyze, for example, how often this well was
used at the beginning of a speaker’s turn, or in
expressing a point contrary to that of a previous
speaker. This can be done because clicking on each
example allows one to see the broader context in
which the word appears. One can also query to see
how frequently well co-occurs with other words
(e.g., well then occurs 164 times, while oh well
occurs 90 times), whether the distributions differ
depending on genre, whether there are differences
across time, etc.
Linguists from across the world use such corpora to
address a wide array of topics in linguistics, including
discourse, but also the lexicon, semantics, and
grammar. The data can also inform education and
language teaching.

One obvious property of spoken language is its production, not as an uninterrupted flow
of sound, but as a series of spurts that are usually between one and two seconds long. These
spurts are sometimes called intonation units (IUs), sometimes prosodic phrases. They
are defined by their prosody , a term that includes variations in pitch , volume , timing ,
and voice quality. IUs are represented here in separate lines. There is a tendency for them
to decline in both pitch and volume from beginning to end. Figure 9.1 illustrates this decli-
nation for line 7, where pitch (more precisely, fundamental frequency ) is shown at the
top, and volume (or intensity ) at the bottom.
There is also a tendency for IUs to be spoken rapidly at the beginning and more slowly at
the end, as in line 1, where the first words isn’t that sad about that were spoken at an aver-
age rate of 90 milliseconds per syllable, while the average rate for the last four words, kid
in the paper , was a much slower 194 milliseconds per syllable, in large part because of the
lengthened pronunciation of the word paper. This deceleration is evident at the bottom of
Figure 9.2.
```

**221 9 Discourse**

```
Each intonation unit ends with a terminal pitch contour
that signals the boundary of the IU as well as the relation of this
IU to others (see Textbox 9.2 for transcription conventions for
terminal contours). Line 1 ended with a rising pitch on the last
syllable of the word paper , inviting agreement from the mother.
This terminal rise is visible in Figure 9.2; it is represented in the transcription with a ques-
tion mark. Lines 13 and 14 were closely related, with line 13 introducing the idea of the
younger brother and line 14 including him in an activity. Figure 9.3 shows line 13 ending
with a very low pitch rise signaling more to come; it is marked in the transcription with a
comma. The pitch prominence given to the word brother and its lengthened pronunciation
are also especially noticeable in this figure.
```

prosody is given in Chapter 10.

```
```
Line 14 then followed with a terminal falling pitch that sig-
naled the closure of this sequence of closely related ideas; this is
marked in the transcription by a period.
Intonation units are sometimes separated by pauses, as can
be seen in the two or three dots at the beginnings of lines 1–6,
where only line 3 followed immediately without a pause.
Intonation units can be sorted into three major types
according to their function. Most common are the substan-
tive IUs that carry forward the ideas on which the conversa-
tion is based. Others serve to regulate the flow of those ideas,
and these regulatory IUs are usually very short, typically sin-
gle words of a type known as discourse particles. All of the mother’s contributions in
Example (1), with the exception of line 7, were of this regulatory type, consisting of noth-
ing more than oh, okay, yeah , and oh really? The third type consists of fragmentary IUs
that are broken off before they are finished, as illustrated in lines 4, 6, 15, 16, and 18.
They are evidence for the online creation of natural discourse , the complex process
through which speakers pull their thoughts together and articulate them in real time under
the pressures of social interaction. During this process, people often change their minds
about what to say or how to say it.
```
9.5 **Navigating through a Topic: Discourse Functions of**

```
Intonation Units
Intonation units cluster within larger units, or conversational topics : extended
segments of thought that are too large to be focused on all at once, but which function at
a more inclusive level to make discourse coherent and to keep the conversation moving
```

**223 9 Discourse**

```
forward. Speakers navigate within a topic using a sequence of ideas expressed in their IUs.
This is best seen through a qualitative analysis of the data, where one carefully listens to
the speech, analyzing the content, function, and contribution of each IU within the inter-
actional context of the conversation.
In line 1 of Example (1), the daughter introduced a new topic into this conversation, a
topic she developed by articulating a succession of ideas all related in some way to the kid
who was in a coma. This topic was sustained until its conclusion in line 35. Its progress was
determined in part by the interaction between the daughter and her mother, and in part by
the daughter’s sequential recall of things she had read in the newspaper. There are a number
of ways in which an intonation unit may relate to its topic. One function is to introduce a
referent , the idea of a person, object, or abstract concept that the conversation will dis-
cuss. This can be seen in line 1, where the speaker introduces a new referent and articulates
her emotional response to the circumstances in which he is involved. This also establishes
a theme of sadness and difficulty. A second discourse function of an IU is the amplification
of an idea that was introduced in a previous IU, as with line 2 where the identity of the kid
was clarified with the relative clause who’s in a coma.
```
```
1 Daughter: ... Isn’t that sád about that kid in the papér?
2 .. Who .. who’s in a cóma
```
### TEXTBOX 9.3 REFERENT TRACKING

```
It is common for a single span of conversational
discourse to be concerned with multiple referents. For
example, the set of human referents in Example (1)
includes the kid in the paper, his dad, the drunk driver,
his younger brother, and the coach. For discourse to be
successful, speakers must ensure that their interlocutors
can determine which referent is being discussed at a
given moment in the discourse. This function, which
is called referent tracking , is accomplished by a
```
```
combination of lexical, prosodic, and grammatical
means. In the first few lines of Example (1), we can see
the daughter use a grammatical device (the relative
clause in line 2), lexical choices (the full noun phrase in
lines 1 and 2 versus the pronoun he in lines 3 through
6), and prosody (such as the prosodic accent given
to him in line 8) to ensure that her mother correctly
identifies the referent and associates him with the
events communicated in the narrative.
```
```
Intonation units can also serve to clarify the identity of a referent, as in lines 3 through
```
6. Line 4 was fragmentary, and whatever the daughter intended to say in line 6 was inter-
rupted by her mother, who is contradicting the daughter’s assertion of the identity of the
person in a coma.

```
3 Daughter: He’s a- the star.. baseball player at BK?
4... And he got the scholarship to-
5... He was the Gatorade player of the year?
6 .. Two years ago [and then he-]
7 Mother: [But I thought] it was his dad who was .. in the hospital.
```
```
The daughter corrected her mother in the next two IUs, repeating what she had said in
line 2. The mother showed her acceptance of the correction with the discourse particle
```

**224 Wallace Chafe**

```
oh. Thus IUs can also correct information and indicate agreement or disagreement with
an interlocutor. (These examples illustrate several devices used for referent tracking; see
Textbox 9.3.)
```
```
8 Daughter: Nó it’s hím.
9 .. He’s [in a cóm]a.
10 Mother: [Oh.]
```
```
The daughter then explained the reason for the coma, which her mother this time
accepted with okay. This is another discourse function of intonation units: elaboration on a
topic through the expression of a reason or attendant circumstances.
```
```
11 Daughter: .. [He got hit] by that drunk driver?
12 Mother: [Okay.]
```
```
Next came a shift in the development of the topic: the introduction of a new subtopic
where the focus moved from the kid in the hospital to his family. First came the introduc-
tion of a new referent: his brother, who was introduced in line 13 and then treated as the
subject of line 14. A sequence of this kind, in which the idea of a person is introduced in
one intonation unit that is followed by a second saying something about that person, is
evidence for a limit on the amount of information an IU can contain (see below).
```
```
13 Daughter: ... And his younger bróther ,
14 played at BK on the fóotball team.
```
```
The introduction of the younger brother led to a mention of what the paper said about
the entire family attending today’s game. After a referent is introduced, attention shifts
from the identity of the referent to the referent’s activities, as with this comment following
the introduction of the younger brother. The daughter’s language at this point became
full of disfluencies, evidence that she was experiencing difficulty in putting her thoughts
together and finding the right language to express what she was thinking. She finally suc-
ceeded in line 19, and in line 20 went on to express the reason the family would attend the
game. The mother once more acknowledged her acceptance of this information with a yeah
before line 21 had been completed.
```
```
15 Daughter: ... And I gue-
16 it was the pa-
17 the árticle was about you know how ,
18 ... they’re all going to-
19 all the family’s gonna go to the gáme today because ,
20 .. spórts are very important.
21 .. In his [fámily] you know ,
22 Mother: [Yeah].
```

**225 9 Discourse**

```
The daughter then amplified the family’s reason for attending the game, with the moth-
er’s oh really expressing surprise at this explanation. This response illustrates another func-
tion of prosodic units: the expression of the emotion, attitude, or evaluation of the speaker.
```
```
23 Daughter: they all used to go watch ... the older brother play baseball ,
24 that’s what he would want ,
25 is for the family to be at the game ,
26 Mother: Oh [really?]
```
### TEXTBOX 9.4 CONSTRUCTED DIALOGUE

```
Quoting the speech of another person is sometimes
called constructed dialogue , because it pretends to
reproduce a person’s language without necessarily
```
```
repeating the exact words. In this case, the quoted
speech provides further elaboration on a major theme
of the conversation: the difficulty of the situation.
```
```
Next came another subtopic, begun again with the introduction of a new referent, the
coach, whose identity was confirmed by the mother in line 30. In line 29, the daughter
attributed the statement that would follow to the coach (or to someone related to him), in
an example of constructed dialogue (see Textbox 9.4).
```
```
27 Daughter: [Uh] but the coach ,
28 I think it’s Tim Beagen.
29 [And one] of the Beagens said you know ,
30 Mother: [Yeah.]
31 Daughter: if you don’t wanna play that’s fine ,
32 if you ... don’t wanna ,
33 you could just go out of the play ,
34 ... you just do whatever ,
```
```
The topic was finally rounded off when the daughter expressed her emotional reaction
to the entire situation by exclaiming aah , a sound she emitted with a breathy voice quality
that conveyed her depth of feeling.
```
```
35 Daughter: but it was like .. aah.
```
```
This exercise has demonstrated that intonation units have a variety of discourse func-
tions with respect to the introduction, construction, and maintenance of a topic. These
functions include introducing referents, clarifying their identities, articulating their activ-
ities, amplifying an idea by expressing reasons or other relevant circumstances, expressing
agreement or disagreement with a previous point, correcting or contradicting a previous
point, and conveying emotions, attitudes, and evaluations. This list is not exhaustive, but
it does identify many of the functions that are central to any conversational exchange.
```

**226 Wallace Chafe**

9.6 **Narratives and Their Structure**

```
One type of topic that often arises during a conversation is a narrative , the recall of a sig-
nificant and coherent set of events in which the speaker was involved, or which the speaker
had learned about from someone else. Narratives consist of a sequence of ideas that follow
a conventional narrative schema , a pattern that captures the way people remember a
sequence of events that they find appropriate to relate to others. The narrative schema
builds toward a climax , something unusual or unexpected that makes the narrative inter-
esting and worth telling. Some or all of the following elements may be included:
```
**a.** Introduction of the narrative
**b.** Introduction of the participants
**c.** Orientation in space
**d.** Orientation in time
**e.** Movement toward a climax
**f.** The climax
**g.** Reaction to the climax
**h.** Results of the climax
**i.** Coda

```
We can follow the way this schema was realized in the narrative given in Example (2). The
audio for Example (2), together with a complete transcription, is available on the website.
```
**a.** _Introduction of the narrative_ : Speakers sometimes say quite explicitly that they are about to tell a
story.

2 _a shaggy dog story_ ,
3 _but as long as we’re talking about that recorder and six-hundred dollars_ ,
4 ... _I’ll tell you the story_.
**b.** _Introduction of participants_ : Narratives always involve one or more characters, and they are usu-
ally introduced near the beginning.
5 ... _Oh gosh_.
6 .. _Uh_.
7 .. _Ray and I and Sue and Buddy_ ,

**c.** _Orientation in space_ : Listeners need to know where something took place.

```
8 ... took a trip ,
9 ... to Mexico City.
10 Jon: ... (sniff)
```
**d.** _Orientation in time_ : Listeners also need to know roughly when it happened.

```
11 Alan: It must’ve been ,
12 .. four to six months after my dad died.
13 That’s how I remember ,
14 he [died in] sixty-s-
15 Jon: [Oh yeah?]
```

**227 9 Discourse**

```
16 Alan: ... December sixty-seven so ,
17 ... sometime in sixty-eight we took the trip ,
e. Movement toward a climax : Once a narrator has established the participants, place, and time, the
next step is to introduce events that will lead to the climax. This portion is sometimes referred to
as a complicating action.
18 it was-
19 .. talked about it for a while ,
20 ... uh ,
21 .. flew down to Mexico City ,
22 ... uh we ,
23 .. couldn’t think of the name of the hotel ,
24 it wouldn’t mean anything now ,
25 but we ended up in a ... fabulous hotel ,
26 ... uh ,
27 .. first night ,
28 we were very unhappy with our rooms ,
29 we went down there ,
30 ... and the next morning ,
31 Buddy who’s a ... early riser anyhow ,
32 was probably up ... four o’clock ,
33 and he went down there ,
34 complained to the manager ,
35 ... so he ,
36 .. cause it was not the .. the accommodation we were supposed to have ,
37 we checked in about eight o’clock at night so it was ,
38 in Mexico that you know is typical.
f. The climax : In this case, the size of the accommodations were greater than anything the narrator
had expected, especially in contrast to the room that was first assigned. The climax need not be
anything wonderfully exciting as long as it conflicts with expectations in some way.
```
```
39 ... Well we ended up with a.. corner .. suite.
40 ... With-
41 ... It was so big ,
g. Reaction to the climax : Listeners often respond to a climax by
showing their appreciation of its unexpectedness. In this case,
Jon laughed, and his two laugh pulses are transcribed with “@”
symbols.
42 Jon: .. @@
h. Results of the climax : Narrators often amplify the unexpected
nature of the climax by providing further information related to it.
```
### SIDEBAR 9.5

```
Laughter is a frequent element
of conversational discourse. It
is transcribed here with an “@”
symbol, with one @ transcribed for
each “pulse” of laughter. So what is
sometimes written as hahaha would
be transcribed @@@.
```

**228 Wallace Chafe**

```
43 Alan: we could have a party for fifty people and not pressed it.
44 .. Three bathrooms in it.
45 ... Two bedrooms ,
46 but they had-
47 but they had an extra guest bathroom ,
48 .. a big bar ,
49 ... it was circ-
50 open on two sides ,
```
```
i. Coda : A story may be summed up or rounded off at the end, as in
this case with an explanation of the contrast between the surpris-
ing size of the room and what the narrator and his wife actually
needed.
```
```
51 course we didn’t even have-
52 we had the two of us.
This example demonstrates that even in spontaneous con-
versation – which may appear chaotic at first glance – the pro-
duction of discourse is structured and follows regular
patterns.
```
9.7 **The Prosodic Realization of Sentences**

```
Chapter 6 presented evidence for the sentence as a unit of syntax consisting of one or
more clauses, which follow regular principles of syntactic structuring. In spoken discourse,
sentences are not isolated constructs but are produced online in the process of meeting the
speaker’s aims within the social environment. They are also produced with prosody – pauses,
intonation, shifts in timing, loudness, and voice quality – which overlays the sequences of
words that are structured into phrases, clauses, and sentences.
Typically, in English, the production of an intonation unit, or prosodic phrase, with a fall-
ing intonation contour indicates that the speaker has reached a
point of closure, while a rising intonation contour indicates that
the speaker intends to continue. However, at times the prosodic
structuring and the syntactic structuring do not coincide in this
way. Consider again the following exchange from Example (1):
```
```
19 Daughter: all the family’s gonna go to the gáme today because ,
20 .. spórts are very important.
21 .. In his [fámily] you know,
22 Mother: [Yeah].
23 Daughter: they all used to go watch ... the older brother play báseball ,
```
```
Line 20 ended with a falling pitch that suggested the end of a sentence. Syntactically,
however, line 21 was a continuation and conclusion of that sentence, in spite of the fact
```
### SIDEBAR 9.7

```
For a more detailed discussion of
prosody, see Chapter 10.
```
### SIDEBAR 9.6

```
For a non-English example of a
narrative used as linguistic data, see
the Seneca Language Profile (LP13).
Further examples of narratives,
with associated sound files, can be
found in the online materials for
the following Language Profiles:
Manange (LP3), South Conchucos
Quechua (LP6), Tsez (LP7), Lowland
Chontal (LP9), and Manambu (LP10).
```

**229 9 Discourse**

```
that the rising pitch at the end of it suggested more to come. Between lines 21 and 23, in
other words, there was a syntactic sentence boundary but not a prosodic one.
The following sequence from Example (2) shows similar inconsistencies between prosody
and syntax. The low rising intonation contour at the end of line 36 suggests continuation,
although the sentence is syntactically complete. Line 37 was truncated (unfinished) syntac-
tically, and line 38 was a complete syntactic sentence in itself.
```
```
31 Buddy who’s a ... early riser anyhow ,
32 was probably up ... four o’clock ,
33 and he went down there ,
34 complained to the manager ,
35 ... so he ,
36 .. cause it was not the .. the accommodation we were supposed to have ,
37 we checked in about eight o’clock at night so it was ,
38 in Mexico that you know is typical.
Prosody, more than syntax, mirrors the flow of a speaker’s thoughts. The analysis of the
syntax and prosody in the production of discourse provides evidence that speakers do not
always think in well-formed sentences but proceed to articulate a series of ideas until they
feel they have reached a point of closure, a point that may or may not coincide with syn-
tactic closure. At that point, their pitch falls, sometimes prematurely from a syntactic point
of view. Another example that illustrates the interplay of syntactic and prosodic structuring
can be found in Stop and Reflect 9.2.
Examples such as these constitute further evidence that sentences are composed online
as speakers pull their thoughts together and decide how to verbalize them. A similar
conclusion emerges from examples where the same person talks about the same thing on
different occasions. In Example (3), a woman talking about an incident at her apartment
introduced her account of it – with continuing prosody after the first line – by saying:
```
```
(3) ... I was sitting there in my chair ,
... just eating my popsicle and-
```
```
On a later occasion, when she told the same story to a different listener, she split these
ideas into two prosodic sentences in the opposite order, although syntactically they
belonged together, as shown in Example (4).
```
```
(4) I was just eating my popsicle.
.. Sitting there in this chair.
```
```
The ideas expressed in the two IUs were the same, but the way they were distributed
across sentences suggested that they had not been stored in the speaker’s memory in pre-
cisely the form the sentences took.
```

9.8 **New, Accessible, and Given Activation States**

```
In producing coherent discourse, speakers must introduce new participants, activities, sit-
uations, and concepts and relate them to what has already been said, and what is assumed
to be in the active consciousness of the addressees. An idea (a participant, state, event,
etc.) is considered given (or activated) if the speaker assumes that the addressee is cur-
rently focused on it; the information is metaphorically “lit up” or active in the person’s
consciousness. An idea is new if the speaker thinks it is unlikely that the hearer is focused
on it; the speaker needs to introduce the idea, that is, to activate it, or “light it up” for the
hearer. In addition, some ideas may not be actively focused on but may be peripheral in
the addressee’s consciousness, for example, an idea that had been mentioned earlier in the
discourse. Such an idea would be considered to be accessible to the addressee, or “dimly
lit” to continue the metaphor. Given, accessible, and new are referred to as activation
states. Speakers must assess the activation states of ideas in order to determine
how to refer to them; the form in which an idea is expressed will depend in part on
this assessment.
We have seen that language expresses the flow of a speaker’s thoughts and that these
thoughts are expressed in a series of intonation units, each about one to two seconds in
length. Each IU conveys the focus of a speaker’s consciousness just prior to or during the
time the IU is being uttered. When we examine how ideas with different activation states
are expressed in a stretch of discourse, we see that there is a limit to the amount of new
information that can be included during each IU. We can see this illustrated by the begin-
ning of Example (1).
```
```
1 Daughter: ... Isn’t that sád about that kid in the paper?
2 .. Who .. who’s in a cóma?
3 He’s a- the star .. baseball player at BK?
4 ... And he got the schólarship to-
5 ... He was the Gatorade player of the year?
6 .. Two years ago [and then he-]
```
### STOP AND REFLECT 9.2 PROSODIC AND SYNTACTIC STRUCTURING

```
Consider the following excerpt from the Santa Barbara Corpus of Spoken American English (SBC: 0003). This
is taken from a conversation between the speaker, her husband, and their friend as they are making dinner
together in her kitchen.
a. .... Let me see.
b. ... What was I in here for ,
c. ... there’s nothing worse than staring like a dope at your own refrigerator.
d. ... Um ,
e. ... oh an egg.
Are the intonation units substantive, regulatory, or fragmentary? What are the boundaries of the syntactic
sentences? How do these match up with rising and falling intonation contours? Why do you suppose the
speaker juxtaposes syntactic and prosodic structures in this way?
```

**231 9 Discourse**

```
The new information in line 1 was the judgment that the kid’s
predicament was sad. The remainder of this phrase, about that
kid in the paper , conveyed an idea that the daughter assumed
was already accessible to her mother, who she assumed had read
the paper too. Once the idea of the kid had been introduced and
activated, that idea became given information, so that it could
be verbalized with nothing more than the weakly stressed pro-
noun he in lines 3 through 6. Thus, given information can be expressed with smaller and
less robustly articulated sounds.
```
```
9.8.1 Identifiability
In English a noun or a noun phrase is often preceded by a definite or indefinite article: the or
a. At the beginning of Example (2) the noun story was preceded by the indefinite article a in
lines 1 and 2 (the latter being followed by the modifier shaggy dog ). When the same referent,
story was mentioned in line 4, it was preceded by the definite article the.
```
```
1 Alan: ... I got a story to tell you ,
2 a shaggy dog story ,
3 but as long as we’re talking about that recorder and six-hundred dollars ,
4 ... I’ll tell you the story.
```
```
The traditional terms “definite” and “indefinite” are misleading, because the distinction
does not involve “definiteness” in its ordinary sense. It is rather a matter of identifiabil-
ity: whether or not the idea expressed by the noun is assumed to be already identi-
fiable by the listener. In line 1, the idea of the story was not shared knowledge and line 2
only amplified that knowledge. However, once it had been introduced in those two lines, its
status changed, and by line 4 it could be preceded by the , signaling the speaker’s assumption
that this story could now be identified.
Similarly, line 8 introduced the idea of a trip assumed to be previously unknown to the
listener and thus expressed as a trip.
```
```
7 Alan: .. Ray and I and Sue and Buddy ,
8 ... took a trip ,
9 ... to Mexico City.
```
```
In contrast, by line 17, the trip was identifiable and could be expressed as the trip.
```
```
17 Alan: ... sometime in sixty-eight we took the trip ,
```
```
The following sequence illustrates greater complexity in this use of the definite and indef-
inite articles. Alan first said:
```
```
23 Alan: .. couldn’t think of the name of the hotel ,
24 it wouldn’t mean anything now ,
```
### SIDEBAR 9.8

```
For more discussion of the way
given versus new information is
expressed in discourse, see Textbox
14.12.
```

**232 Wallace Chafe**

```
He could assume that the listener would know, based on prior mention of a trip to Mexico
City, that he and his wife had stayed in a hotel, and also that the hotel undoubtedly had
a name. This context made the ideas of both the hotel and its name identifiable. It would
have been inappropriate to say couldn’t think of a name of a hotel , because it would have
implied that no hotel had yet been chosen. At this point he might have gone on to say but
the hotel was fabulous , but what he said instead was,
```
```
25 but we ended up in a ... fabulous hotel ,
```
```
In effect he made a new start by explicitly introducing the hotel as if it had not been men-
tioned before, letting it now become the setting for the room change that was described in
what followed.
In Example (1), a number of ideas were identifiable because they were accessible from the
context or from the listener’s prior knowledge, as with the paper, the star baseball player, the
scholarship , and the Gatorade player of the year:
```
```
1 Daughter: ... Isn’t that sád about that kid in the paper?
2 .. Who .. who’s in a cóma?
3 He’s a- the star .. baseball player at BK?
4 ... And he got the schólarship to-
5 ... He was the Gatorade player of the year?
```
```
Identifiability in English is expressed not only by the but also by demonstratives like that
and pronouns like he , both of which are illustrated in this example. Evidently the daughter
was able to refer to that kid in the paper because the words in the paper identified which kid
it was, and because she assumed that her mother had already read the article in question.
```
9.8.2 Subjects

```
The grammatical subjects of clauses usually express ideas that are both identifiable and
given, as with the three examples of he in lines 3 through 5 above. That is not the whole
story, however, as illustrated by the following sequence from Example (1). The grammatical
subjects his younger brother, the article, all the family , and sports do not qualify as given ideas,
but as accessible ones.
```
```
13 Daughter: ... And his younger bróther ,
14 played at BK on the fóotball team.
15 ... And I gue-
16 it was the pa-
17 the árticle was about you know how ,
18 ... they’re all going to-
19 all the family’s gonna go to the gáme today because ,
20 .. spórts are very important.
21 .. In his [fámily] you know ,
```

**233 9 Discourse**

```
The ideas of the younger brother and his family were accessible from shared knowledge of
the kid’s background. The idea of the article was accessible from the mention of the paper in
line 1. The idea of sports was accessible from prior mention of baseball and football.
Syntactic subjects, in short, although they are most often given, are sometimes instead
accessible, although they are still identifiable. That may be especially true in a conversa-
tion between two people who share as much prior knowledge as a mother and daughter.
Syntactic subjects, on the other hand, seldom refer to new ideas that are non-identifiable.
The study of discourse reveals that information of different types receives different
grammatical treatments, thus that grammatical structures are used to play par-
ticular functions in discourse.
```
### CHAPTER SUMMARY

```
We have seen that language is usually produced in a series of brief spurts or intonation
units that are usually restricted to the expression of a single new idea. A larger level of
discourse is realized in topics, or coherent idea clusters. Topics are too large to be focused
on in their entirety; they are navigated in a series of IUs that express the included ideas.
The direction of the navigation may be guided by the interaction between different parties
to a conversation, as in Example (1), or by a conventional schema like the narrative
schema that was illustrated in Example (2).
Discourse structure influences words and sentences in a variety of ways. Sentences
do not always express stable elements of thought but are composed online as a person
is talking. Ideas may be new, accessible, or given, thus determining whether they are
expressed with prosodically prominent nouns or with weakly stressed pronouns. They
may also be identifiable or non-identifiable, as expressed by the presence of the definite or
indefinite article. The subjects of clauses are usually both identifiable and given, although
sometimes they are accessible from the context or from prior shared knowledge. The study
of discourse and the way it is structured demonstrate that syntax cannot be adequately
explained in isolation from the larger context in which words and sentences occur.

### EXERCISES

**1.** Use the following narrative (slightly edited from a real conversation) as a source of data.

```
Last summer I was hiking with my brother in Yosemite, and we were almost to the lake where we were
going to go, and the air was pretty thin. And there were two women hiking up ahead of us. We got to a
rise, and the lake was right there where we were going to camp. And the two of them got to the rise, and
the next minute they just fell over. Totally. (You’re kidding.) I guess the stop was just too much, and both
of them just totally passed out. They both came to life very quickly, but I guess the hike, and then all of a
sudden stopping, and the oxygen thing must have really confused them. It was really odd.
i. Identify the parts of the narrative schema. (Not all the parts need be present.)
ii. Find all of the examples of the definite article and explain why each noun phrase is identifiable.
iii. Find all of the syntactic subjects and determine whether each of them expresses given or accessible
information. Why do you suppose the speaker avoided saying “two women were hiking up ahead of us”?
```
**2.** The following narrative is another slightly edited excerpt from a different conversation.

```
Steve and I went skiing that day. Harsh voice: God! It was really windy! When we get to the top of the
chairlift, it was like you were a clapper on a bell you know, when you went to get off, and we had to land
like that you know, but a huge gust came by, just as we were landing. We were gonna like- Falsetto: Aaah!
You know we were coming in like this, you know, and, you know, so we’d wait to- Shouted: All right now!
Zhoom! We jumped off. Laughter: It was great!
i. Identify the parts of the narrative schema. (Not all need be present.)
ii. Try to imagine the special voice qualities that are suggested by the words added in italics. What do
these voice qualities add to the discourse?
iii. There were five occurrences of the phrase you know , an expression that occurs very often in modern
colloquial conversation. Linguists disagree on its function, but discuss briefly what you think its function
might be.
```
**3.** Read through the following stretch of conversational discourse (edited from SBC: 003 “conceptual
    pesticides”):
    1 ROY: _Do you have a particular, um,_
    2 _use for the red peppers,_
    3 _as opposed to the yellow or green peppers._
    4 MARILYN: _No, no._
    5 _It was all .. salad peppers._
    6 ROY: _It’s all salad peppers._
    7 MARILYN: _Mhm._
    8 ROY: _.. In that case I will use a yellow pepper for this evening._
    9 MARILYN: _.. Oh, .. fabulous._
    10 PETE: _What can I do._
    11 MARILYN: _Would you like to ... string the beans?_
    12 PETE: _Sure._
    13 MARILYN: _Man that’s a big hunk of fish._
    14 PETE: _Where do you want ’em put?_
    15 MARILYN: _Shit, it’s a huge–_
    16 PETE: _Are they just going .. on that? Or ..._
    17 MARILYN: _Uh ... you wanna put ‘em in a .. colander,_
    18 _and then ... wash ‘em?_
    **i.** Give one example each of an intonation unit from this excerpt which is (a) substantive, (b) regulatory,
       and (c) fragmentary.
    **ii.** Give one example each of an intonation unit from this excerpt that performs each of the following
       functions:
          **a.** Introduction of a topic
          **b.** Amplification of an idea
          **c.** Clarification of identity of a referent


**235 9 Discourse**

```
d. Correction/contradiction of a previous point
e. Indication of agreement or disagreement
f. Articulation of activities of referents
g. Expression of emotions (like surprise), attitudes, or evaluations
```
4. Record, transcribe, and analyze a short narrative. Find someone who is willing to briefly describe an
    important event in their life. Here are some useful prompts:
    tWhat was your favorite travel experience?
    tTell me about the day your child was born/you met your partner.
    tWhat is the closest that you have come to death?
    tTell me about an experience with your father/mother/favorite teacher that had an impact on your life.
    i. Record the conversation. You can use a phone or computer as a recording device.
    tEthics: After you turn it on, tell the person that you are making a recording, that you will use the recording
       for a school assignment, and that you will not use it for any purpose without their permission. Tell them
       that if they would like a copy of the recording and/or your assignment, you will provide it to them. Ask
       them if they understand and agree to this.
    tHave a conversation with the person, giving them a set of prompts, and ask them to choose what they
       would most like to talk about.
    tHave the person tell the story, but do it as part of the natural conversation; you don’t need to be quiet, but
       can comment, acknowledge with _uh huh_ or other backchannels, or ask questions.
    tRecord for at least two minutes.
    tWhen you are done, thank the person for their participation.
    ii. Carefully listen to the conversation several times.
    iii. Transcribe the conversation.
    tIf it is much longer than two minutes, then choose a section at least two minutes in length that contains
       a coherent narrative or narrative chunk. If it is only a chunk of a narrative, summarize the other parts of
       the story.
    tDo your best to break it into intonation units, putting one unit on each line.
    tNumber each line.
    tMark the speaker name with initials at the beginning of each turn.
    tIf two speakers are talking at the same time, put the transcription in square brackets, for example:
       S: _I don’t think [you should go]_
       L: _[Mom, I’ve got to!]_
    Be sure that BOTH overlapped portions are in brackets.
    tDo your best to transcribe terminal pitch contours, following the conventions in Textbox 9.2.
    tIf you think a particular word is being emphasized, put it in CAPS.
    tIf someone breaks off a line and abandons it, indicate that with two dashes:
       S: _Maybe he’s --_
    tBe sure to transcribe backchannel responses such as “mm-hmm,” “oh,” etc.
    tYou can transcribe relevant non-linguistic sounds in double parentheses
       S: _I hope not_ ((cough))
    iv. Analyze the narrative.
    tDid the narrative follow the typical schema (see Section 9.6)? If so, state the parts of the narrative and
       indicate what line numbers contributed to each part. If not, in what way did it deviate?
    tDescribe the narrative in terms of topics and subtopics.
    tChoose three sentences that occurred over more than one intonation unit. Referring to Section 9.7, discuss
       how the division of the speech into intonation units allows the speaker to present a series of ideas and
       mirrors the flow of thought.


# 10 Prosody

_The Music of Language_

### CHAPTER PREVIEW

```
We have seen that language is typically not produced in sentences isolated from commuicative
contexts but is embedded in longer stretches of discourse and social interactions. Within this
broader context, speakers need to direct their listeners’ attention to particularly important parts
of their utterances, and to convey a range of emotions and attitudes.
Speakers do not simply produce language as long sequences of consonants and vowels
in monotonous strings of identical timing. Instead, they vary the rate, pitch, and volume
of their speech to add nuance and meaning beyond what is conveyed by the words
themselves.
Prosody is a cover term for such variations in pitch, volume, timing, and voice quality. These
properties accompany the vowels, consonants, and syllables of spoken language. They function
to delimit linguistic units like phrases and sentences while signaling relations between them.
These properties also make certain portions of our utterances more prominent, and they are
basic to the expression of emotion and attitude.
This chapter will present descriptions of various prosodic phenomena in discourse and
methods for transcribing them. It explores some of the functions of prosody, including the
organization and evaluation of ideas. It also discusses different types of voice qualities and how
these, and other prosodic variables, are manipulated by speakers for rhetorical effect.

tlist the properties of speech that are covered by the term prosody;
tlist the four functions of prosody;
tlisten to a sample of speech and identify its prosodic properties;
trelate those properties to their functions;
ttranscribe a sample of speech and mark some of its prosodic properties;
tjudge the effects of prosody in commercials, speeches, or other public uses of language.
```
10.1 **Segmental and Prosodic Properties of Speech**

```
The sounds of spoken language have both segmental and pro-
sodic properties. These two terms do not refer to different sounds,
but to different aspects of the same sound, just as a painting has
both form and color at the same time. The term “segmental”
refers to the way sounds constitute segments of language, such
as vowels and consonants. The term prosody refers to varia-
tions in four different aspects of sounds: their pitch , volume ,
timing , and voice quality. Sometimes these properties have
been imagined as “riding on top of” the segments, and thus they
have sometimes been called suprasegmental.
We begin with an example in which a woman, in the course of a conversation, says the
utterance in (1).
```
```
(1) Sure. You’ve got a real problem.
The representation of spoken language here is spelled with ordinary English orthogra-
phy, which is largely restricted to the segmental representation of sounds (see Textbox
10.1). This way of writing language is familiar to all of us. It captures the bare ideas that
were communicated but leaves open such factors as the timing of those ideas, which
ideas were emphasized, how they were related, and the speaker’s attitude toward them.
To be sure, the fact that the words in (1) were distributed across two separate sentences,
both of which ended with a falling pitch, is suggested by the capital letters and the
periods, but that is about as far as ordinary writing usually goes in terms of representing
prosody.
To know exactly what (1) sounded like when it was spoken, one needs to hear it.
Nevertheless, acoustic displays, such as that in Figure 10.1, can be useful in providing visual
representations of several kinds of prosodic features. The words at the top are distributed
according to their relative timing. We can see that the words sure and problem occupied
more time than the others, whereas the sequence you’ve got a was uttered rapidly. Directly
below the words is a waveform that shows how positive and negative energy were dis-
tributed across the 1.5 seconds occupied by the entire sequence. We can see a pause, shown
at the top with three dots and measurable as 123 milliseconds, which intervened between
sure and what followed. The waveform also suggests the relative intensity of these
```

terms and bolded terms throughout
this chapter in the Glossary (at the

```
words (perceived as loudness) , the loudest being real , the next loudest got and the first
syllable of problem , the next loudest a and the second syllable of problem , and the softest
being you’ve.
```
### TEXTBOX 10.1 MEANINGS CONVEYED BY SEGMENTAL AND SUPRASEGMENTAL

### PROPERTIES

```
The favorable treatment our writing system gives
to segmental sounds reflects the fact that they are
responsible for conveying ideas. A speaker may
communicate ideas of events, states, people, and objects
```
```
by expressing them with linguistic elements like verbs,
nouns, and adjectives. In addition to meanings of that
sort, language at the same time expresses meanings of
other kinds; these meanings are the focus of this chapter.
```
```
The display along the bottom of Figure 10.1 shows the fundamental frequency (F 0 ) of
the sound wave, with levels given in Hertz (cycles per second) at the left. Changes in F 0 are
perceived roughly as changes in pitch. Strictly speaking, there is a need to distinguish
physical properties such as intensity and F 0 from perceptual properties such as loudness and
pitch, which refer to the way our brains interpret those physical properties in particular
contexts. However, the relation between physical sounds and our perception of them is
close enough that we can view Figure 10.1 as a useful approximation to the loudness and
pitch that we hear.
In the bottom display, we can see that the words sure and problem were both pronounced
with a pitch contour that rose and then fell. Comparing those two rise–fall contours, we
can also see that the baseline pitch of sure was higher than that of problem. The impression
given by this raised baseline is that sure was an emotionally charged answer to a preceding
question, whereas you’ve got a real problem provided more specific information that culmi-
nated in an emotionally tinged problem. This display also shows that you’ve and real were
somewhat higher in pitch than got a , with those two last words being the least prominent
part of the entire sequence in terms of pitch. It is noticeable that real was the loudest word
```
```
Figure 10.1 Waveform and fundamental frequency in Example (1)
```

**239 10 Prosody**

```
in the entire sequence, although problem was considerably higher in pitch. The fact that
the word real functions to intensify the degree of the problem may explain its heightened
volume, while the higher pitch on problem is consistent with its central role as the carrier of
new information.
There is no universally accepted way of representing prosody in transcripts of speech; dif-
ferent conventions have been followed by different researchers, depending on their interests
and goals. One way of capturing the prosodic features described above was first developed
in Berkeley, California, and is now in use in Santa Barbara. It is illustrated in (2), where the
sequence is divided into two intonation units that are represented on separate lines. An
intonation unit (IU) is a prosodically coherent segment of speech, a spurt of language
whose properties are discussed later in this chapter. In this chapter, a sequence of words
within a single IU will be referred to as a phrase. The three dots at the beginning of (2b)
indicate a pause. The rise–fall in pitch that characterized both sure and the first syllable of
problem is shown using circumflex accent marks over the vowels, while secondary promi-
nences are shown with grave accent marks (`) on you’ve and real. The periods at the ends of
the lines show the falling pitches at the ends of each of the two intonation units. The arrows
at the beginning and end of (2a) capture its raised baseline. A transcript of this sort can help
a reader imagine or mimic something that comes close to the way the prosody was actually
produced. You can listen to the sound files that accompany the examples in this chapter by
going to the website.

### STOP AND REFLECT 10.1 DIFFERENT MEANINGS FROM DIFFERENT PROSODIES

```
How many ways can you say You’ve got a real problem to produce different meanings? Listen to your different
prosodies and do your best to transcribe what you have said. What are the different meanings? When you are
finished, listen to the associated sound file on the website to hear another speaker’s various pronunciations of
this sentence.
```
```
(2) a. ↑ Sûre. ↑
b. ... Yòu’ve got a rèal prôblem.
```
```
It is important to note that any given phrase can be produced with many prosodic forms;
see Stop and Reflect 10.1.
```
```
10.1.1 Four Visual Displays
Figure 10.2 supplements Figure 10.1 by illustrating four different ways the properties of
sound can be visually represented for further analysis. You can listen to the utterance of a
woman saying Oh I don’t recognize that in the sound file corresponding to Example (3) on
the website. This utterance, like that in (1), occupies approximately 1.5 seconds. The relative
timing display at the top, the waveform below it, and the F 0 display are already familiar from
Figure 10.1. The graph just below the waveform pools positive and negative energy to give a
clearer picture of variations in intensity. We can see that what this woman said was loudest
at the beginning, with a peak on the pronoun I. After that, the volume gradually declined,
only to increase again on the word that.

The F 0 display illustrates a tendency to perceive elements
toward the end of an intonation unit as higher in pitch than
they really are. Listening to this phrase, you might find that
you hear the word that as carrying approximately the same high
pitch as the word I near the beginning, even though you can see
that its fundamental frequency is significantly lower. I was char-
acterized by a rising pitch that peaked at 222 Hz, straddling the
boundary between I and don’t , at which point the pitch fell steeply. In contrast, the highest
pitch during the word that was only 173 Hz. (For more on the use of technology to study
prosody, see Textbox 10.2.)

### TEXTBOX 10.2 TECHNOLOGIES AND PROSODIC RESEARCH

```
Prosody has been studied in various ways for a long
time, but our understanding of it has been greatly
enhanced by modern technology. First came the ability
to record sounds mechanically and then electronically,
and to replay them for further study. But more recent
digital technologies have given us analyses of sounds
that are more diverse and more accurate than anything
that was possible in the past.
In earlier times, pitch, loudness, timing, and voice
quality could be studied only through investigators’
subjective impressions of what they were hearing,
```
```
but those impressions could vary considerably with
the “ear” and training of the investigator. Although
much remains to be understood, technology has
brought a new level of objectivity to prosodic
research.
Today, high-quality recordings are made digitally with
smaller and less obtrusive devices. The digital sound
files are ready to be analyzed acoustically by a range of
computer programs that are widely available. One open-
access program commonly used by linguists is Praat,
which is available for free download at http://www.praat.org.

The display at the bottom of Figure 10.2 is a spectrogram , where the relative amount of
energy at different frequencies is indicated by degrees of darkness: greater energy is shown
with darker shading. This display is useful in showing the timing of segments, the quality of
vowels, and other aspects of sound that may include voice quality. In this case the creaky
voice at the end of the word that can be clearly seen in the irregular vertical striations at
the right end of the spectrogram, as well as at the end of the waveform at the top. One way
in which this utterance might be transcribed is shown in (3), where the creaky voice on the
last word is shown using a dotted underline. The circumflex accent (^) shows the rise–fall
pitch contour that began on the word I. Other prominences are shown with the acute
accent marks ( ́) on the first syllable of recognize and on the word that.

10.2 The Four Functions of Prosody
Prosody has several distinct functions, including the delineation of units and their rela-
tions, and the expression of prominences and emotions. These four functions are illus-
trated in Figure 10.3. Prosody serves both to organize and to evaluate the ideas that
language conveys. Organization includes delimiting speech units such as intonation units
and sentences while at the same time signaling how those units relate to the flow of ideas.
Evaluation includes the assignment of prominences to new and emphasized information as
well as the expression of emotions and attitudes. The first three of the four functions at the
bottom of Figure 10.3 are observable in any sample of speech, whereas emotion may or may
not be evident (though even an absence of emotion can itself be regarded as an attitude).
All four of these prosodic functions are illustrated in the next example, taken from a
conversation during which a woman related how she and her husband arrived home from

a trip, only to find a stranger stealing lemons from a tree in their backyard. She introduced
her story by producing the utterance in (4), which is written using standard English spelling.
```
**(4)** _And we’re pulling up and I see this girl, who I’d never seen before, sort of dart out of our driveway._

```
Although the standard English orthography used in (4) provides only minimal prosodic
information, it does contain some clues. The capital letter at the beginning and the period at
the end suggest a prosodic contour whose boundaries coincided with the entire grammatical
sentence. The commas surrounding “who I’d never seen before” reflect its syntactic status as a
nonrestrictive relative clause , suggesting that this phrase might have been separated from
what came before and after it through the use of pauses and a prosodic contour of its own.
```
10.2.1 The Delineation of Units: Intonation Units

```
As outlined in Figure 10.3, one function of prosody is to segment
speech into intonation units like the six that are written in sepa-
rate lines in (5). (See Sidebar 10.4 for a note on the transcription.)
It is characteristic of speech to be uttered in brief phrases of this
kind, usually approximately one second long and typically con-
taining between three and five words. Many of these IUs convey
substantive ideas, as is true of all except line (a) in this example. In (a) the word and links
what was to come to the preceding talk about returning from a trip, while the pause filler
uh helps the speaker hold the floor, both thus regulating the flow of information. IUs can
thus be categorized as either regulatory like line (a), or substantive like all the others.
```
**(5) a.** ... _ánd uh-_
**b.** .. _we’re púlling up;_
**c.** ... _and I sèe this gî=rl._
**d.** .. _(who I’d néver seen before-)_
**e.** _sort of d=árt?_
**f.** _óut of our dríveway._

```
Figure 10.4 tracks fundamental frequency through the entire sequence. The six intonation
units and the intervening pauses are identified at the top. The pauses are shown with two
or three dots, suggesting their relative lengths in a rough way. It can be seen that the pitch
declines toward the end, and that it peaks during (b) and (c).

```
Intonation units are characterized by various properties, not
all of which need to be present in any particular case. Often there
is an initial pause: a period of silence presumably occupied by
cognitive activity of some kind before the next IU is uttered. In
Example (5), pauses preceded all but the last two IUs. Sometimes
pitch and volume decline in the course of an IU, and an IU may
begin rapidly and decelerate toward the end. This deceleration is
especially evident in Figure 10.5, which shows the relative dura-
tion of the five words in (c). You can see that they becoming
progressively longer over the course of the IU.
```
```
10.2.2 Signaling Relations: Terminal Pitch Contours
The most consistent property of an intonation unit is a terminal pitch contour , which
not only delimits each phrase but also indicates how the phrase relates to the larger
context : whether, for example, there is more to come within the current sequence of ideas,
or whether a sequence has been completed. Figure 10.6 extracts the terminal contours from
each of the IUs in (5) and lets us compare their shapes.
The terminal contours in (a), and uh , and (d), who I’d never seen before , both descend to a
level pitch, suggesting more to come. Compare this to the transcription in (5), above. You
will note that the ‘more to come’ contour is transcribed with a hyphen (-) at the ends of
these two IUs.
```
### SIDEBAR 10.4

```
Transcription Note
Intonation units are transcribed
on separate lines of text. Thus in
Example (5), there are six IUs, each
transcribed on a separate line. Dots
at the beginning of an IU represent
preceding pauses; two dots are used
for short pauses and three for long
pauses.

```
The terminal contour in (b), we’re pulling up , has a rise on pull - and a fall on - ing up , also
suggesting more to come but conveying a more active emotional involvement with what
will follow. In (5) this contour is transcribed with a semicolon (;).
The word girl in (c) was also spoken with a rise and fall, but unlike pulling up it fell close
to the bottom of the speaker’s range, suggesting a temporary closure that was transcribed
in (5) with a period (.).
The broken trajectory during the terminal contour in (c)
reflects a harsh voice quality, expressing in this case a strongly
judgmental emotional involvement. The rise–fall during girl is
transcribed in (5) with a circumflex accent mark (^), and the
lengthened pronunciation of this word with an equal sign (=).
In (e) the word dart rises slightly to a pitch in the middle of this
speaker’s range. This contour is typically associated with yes/no
questions and thus is transcribed in (5) with a question mark (?).
The initial d of dart is lengthened, and then pronounced with an
explosive release that appears as a brief high pitch at the beginning
of (e). The lengthening of this consonant is transcribed in (5) with
an equal sign (=).
In (f), final closure of the entire sequence is signaled by a fall
to the bottom of the speaker’s range during driveway , transcribed
in (5) with a period (.).
In summary, terminal pitch contours are critical parts of intonation units. They serve a
wide range of important functions: they help delineate IU boundaries, mark relationships
between IUs, differentiate questions and statements, and sometimes convey evaluative or
emotional content. Particular transcription conventions have been designed to record these
and other prosodic features (see Textbox 10.3).
```
10.2.3 Indicating Prominence

```
We have seen that prosody not only delimits IUs but also signals their relation to the larger
context. Another function of prosody is to assign degrees of prominence to various lin-
guistic elements at several levels. At the level of individual words, greater prominence or
```
### SIDEBAR 10.5

```
While it is common cross-
linguistically for rising pitch to
indicate questions and falling
pitch to indicate statements, some
languages have different patterns.
Textbox 2.7 discusses this with
regard to the Native American
language Chickasaw. The African-
American English Language Profile,
Section LP11.3.1, describes how the
pitch on questions for some speakers
of African-American English differs
from that in other American English
varieties.
```

**245 10 Prosody**

```
stress is assigned to certain syllables, as illustrated in Figure 10.2 above by the promi-
nence given to the first syllable of the word recognize. In that example, the prominence
was a matter of higher pitch, whereas loudness remained relatively constant throughout
the word. The position of stress in English words is the result of historical processes that
took place at different times in the history of the language. Sometimes stress distinguishes
different meanings, as the noun cóntract (a legal document) is distinct from the verb contráct
(decrease in size). In the latter case the lesser prominence of the first syllable has led to a
reduced vowel quality as well. In some languages prosodic prominence on certain syllables
within words follows a more consistent pattern that serves to delimit the words themselves,
as with the first syllable stress in Finnish, the final syllable stress in Armenian, or the pre-fi-
nal syllable stress in Mohawk.
At a more inclusive level, entire intonation units may be more or less prominent
with relation to other intonation units. One way to measure the prominence of an IU
is by measuring its mean intensity , the arithmetic average of the intensity measurements
over the IU. Figure 10.7 plots the mean intensity in decibels of the IUs from Example (5).
You can see that the IUs (d), who I’d never seen before , and (f), out of our driveway , are conspic-
uously less prominent than the others.
Another way to measure relative prominence is with tempo, since more rapid phrases
are less prominent than slower ones. Prominence may be expressed by a lengthening of at
least some of the segments. Figure 10.8 plots tempo in terms of syllables per second. You
can see that (d), who I’d never seen before , is uttered more rapidly than the other intonation
units. Thus, the reduced prominence of (d) is evident not only in its reduced volume but
also in its faster tempo. Its lesser prominence was transcribed in Example (5) by enclosing it
in parentheses. It was in fact a parenthetical remark.
Relative prominence also characterizes parts of intonation units. Figure 10.9 focuses on IU
(b), we’re pulling up , tracking both pitch (top line) and volume (bottom line). The word we’re
conveys information that was already given (the idea of the speaker and her husband), not

```
only because they had already been mentioned in the conversation but also because they
were participants in the conversation itself. The new idea in this IU is conveyed by the
phrase pulling up. After the relatively low pitch on we’re , the pitch rises to a peak during the
word pulling. With respect to volume, the less prominent word we’re actually begins with the
heightened volume that often characterizes phrase-initial words,
but then the volume falls quickly to a low point before begin-
ning to increase with pulling up , reaching a maximum during up.
The decline in pitch during up , seemingly at odds with its vol-
ume, does not reflect a lack of prominence but was determined
by the terminal contour assigned to this intonation unit. Thus,

```
pulling up can be said to receive the phrasal accent , which marks these words as the most
prominent phrase in this IU.
Figure 10.10 provides similar information for IU (c), and I see this girl. In terms of pitch,
the most prominent element was the new idea expressed by girl , with a secondary promi-
nence on see. Least prominent were and, I , and this. The prominence of girl was expressed
with heightened volume as well, already anticipated at the beginning of this. As in the last
example, there was increased volume at the very beginning of this IU.
```
```
10.2.4 Expression of Emotions and Attitudes
A major contribution of prosody is the role it plays in expressing emotions and attitudes. In
Example (5) there were two places where the speaker’s emotional involvement in what she
was saying was conspicuously expressed by her prosody. One example is the word girl in IU
(c) of Example (5). You can hear this in the corresponding sound file on the website, and
you can see this both in the lengthening of girl (relative to the other words), visible in Figure
10.10, and especially in the rise–fall pitch contour of that word. The lengthening combined
with the pitch pattern express the speaker’s emotional attitude toward this girl that might
be described as a feeling of disdain.
A different emotional prosody is evident in the word dart. Figure 10.11 shows a slight rise
to a moderately high pitch on that word, suggesting a questioning attitude.
There is also an increase in volume that is evident at the bottom of Figure 10.11. You can
see a dual peak of volume, first on the explosive release of the consonant “d” and then on
the “art” portion that follows. The special treatment of the “d” is visible in a brief segment
of higher pitch at that point, and in the spectrogram in Figure 10.12, where you can see a
spike of acoustic energy accompanying the release of the “d.” All of these factors reinforce
a feeling of sudden swift movement that is conveyed by the word dart itself.
A striking example of the prosodic display of emotion is provided in another conversa-
tion, during which one of the participants uttered the sentence in (6).
```
```
(6) Thàt was the û==gliest set of shoes I ever saw in my lîfe.
```
```
Sound file
for (6)
```

**248 Wallace Chafe**

```
The pitch pattern for (6) is shown in Figure 10.13. The initial vowel of ugliest was uttered
with extreme lengthening and a very steep rise in pitch at the beginning, followed by a
slow fall and leveling off, all of which capture the feeling of disgust this speaker felt toward
the shoes. The final contour on the word life at the end shows a second rise–fall pattern,
finishing off the entire IU with a continued expression of emotional involvement.
```
10.3 **Special Voice Qualities**

```
At the beginning of this chapter, prosody was defined as a cover term for variations in pitch,
volume, timing, and voice quality. Aside from the creaky voice quality in Example (3), the
examples so far have focused largely on pitch, volume, and timing. Voice quality is a
more diverse feature than the others, involving various ways people modify a nor-
mal speaking voice, most often with special effects that are produced in the larynx.
One example is harsh voice , produced by irregular vibrations that are superimposed on
ordinary voicing. It typically expresses strong emotion, often of
anger or fear. In the following example, the speaker is describing
a childhood incident in which he was approached by a gang of
bullies. When he saw them coming, he expressed his anxiety by
saying:
```
```
(7) Here they â=re.
```
```
The harsh quality of the last word can be heard in the sound file for Example (7), and is vis-
ible in the waveform in Figure 10.14. Harsh voice resembles creaky voice, but the vibrations
are usually at a higher frequency and there is a more extreme irregularity in the sound wave.
A different voice quality is laughter, which consists of spasmodic pulses of air that are
usually (though not always) voiced as they pass through the larynx. Laughter comes in
```
```

```
many varieties, but Figure 10.15 shows the waveform of a laugh that includes twelve voiced
exhalations followed by a prolonged inhalation that serves to replenish the exhaled air.
The laugh pulses are paced at a typical rate of slightly more than five per second. The final
inhalation is also visible at the end of the waveform.
Another voice quality is whispering , where the vocal folds in the larynx do not come
together as closely as in normal voicing. In Example (8), a man (Speaker A) lists possible occu-
pations for his girlfriend (Speaker B), at which point she pauses and whispers to herself, an
explorer! Her whispering suggests a private emotional involvement in this particular option.
```
```
(8) a. Being a doctor or â screen writer or an actress or a philanthropist or an explorer
b. (whispered) An explorer!
```
```
The spectrogram in Figure 10.16 contrasts the man’s statement in (8a) with the woman’s
exclamation in (8b). The final portion shows a diminished waveform, indicating reduced

```
10.4 **Differing Prosodic Styles**

```
All the examples so far were taken from recordings of face-to-face informal interactions.
Conversational language is the most basic of all language uses. It is the way most of us use
language most of the time, and it probably has been the dominant use of language ever
since language evolved into its present form. Nevertheless, language is used in many other
ways too: in speeches, debates, oral arguments, sermons, and so on, not to mention the
many varieties of written language, from shopping lists to newspaper reports to novels.
We have already noticed that ordinary writing does not in itself provide very many ways
to mark prosody, but prosody inevitably enters the picture whenever written language is
read aloud. Prosody can be manipulated for different rhetorical effects and can be a
significant feature of speech styles.
In (9) there is a brief excerpt from a famous speech whose written version has been
reprinted many times, but whose audio and video versions are also easily accessible. The
speech is powerful even in written form, but it is much more powerful with access to the
sound. The orator’s style was inherited from a long tradition in which prosody was exploited
to add significantly to the effectiveness of the bare words.

### STOP AND REFLECT 10.2 PROSODIC INTERPRETATIONS

```
As you read the speech excerpt in (9), try to imagine how it sounded. Then listen to the corresponding sound
file. How did the prosody you heard differ from what you had imagined based on reading the written words?
```
```
Figure 10.17 shows the pitch contours of this excerpt (along the top) and the loudness
contours (along the bottom). One obvious feature is the clear separation of the four IUs,
separated by pauses of approximately a second and a half. The first two IUs each end with
falling pitches that would otherwise be typical of the ends of sentences. The third rises to a
higher pitch, and the final IU increases in pitch toward a climax on the words true meaning ,
with a falling pitch at the end.
This distinctive oratorical style, used here by Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., was characteris-
tic of a style of preaching widely used in African American churches. The prosodic structure
is compelling, powerfully capturing the attention of the listener as it moves from IU to IU.
The skillful application of prosody is an important component of acting on the stage.
William Shakespeare, like other playwrights of his time, wrote most of his characters’ lan-
guage in a fixed prosodic style known as iambic pentameter. Their speech was divided into
separate written lines, each of which was further divided into five iambic feet , which
are units composed of a sequence of two syllables, the second of which is stressed. A strict
adherence to this pattern would impose the prosody shown in (10) on the beginning of
Henry V , Act 4, Scene 1.
```
```
(10) a. Now éntertáin conjécture óf a tíme ,
b. when créeping múrmur ánd the póuring dárk ,
c. fills thé wide véssel óf the únivérse.
```
```
Try reading these lines aloud with strict adherence to the iambic pattern indicated with
the accent marks. Notice how such a reading conflicts with a more natural prosody. Then
ignore the accent marks and read the same lines again, this time trying to express the
meaning of the words. Finally, listen to what one person did with this passage, and notice
the extent to which he departed from iambic pentameter. The transcription in (11) captures
some of his interpretation, with extra line breaks used to show variations in his timing.
Imagine how dull the play would sound if actors performed it throughout with strict adher-
ence to iambic pentameter.

Consider next a concluding excerpt from the 1944 movie Gaslight. The character
played by Ingrid Bergman has discovered that her husband was using a variety of tricks
to make her believe she was going mad. His goal was to have her declared insane so that
he could acquire full rights to some expensive jewels that had belonged to her aunt,
whom in fact he had murdered. In this final scene his treachery has been discovered, and
his wife taunts him as he is tied to a chair. Try saying these lines aloud or to yourself with
a prosody that captures the woman’s emotions on discovering her husband’s treachery,
although she still feels a twinge of regret for this tragic conclusion to their marriage (see
Stop and Reflect 10.3).
```
```
(12) If I were not mad I could have helped you. Whatever you had done I could have pitied and protected
you. Because I am mad I hate you. Because I am mad I have betrayed you, but because I am mad,
I’m rejoicing with my heart without a shred of pity, without a shred of regret, watching you go with
glory in my heart! Mr. Cameron come! [She opens the door.] Come Mr. Cameron take this man
away! Take this man away.

On a more prosaic level, all of us are frequently exposed to language that is read aloud,
especially on television or radio. Speakers vary in their ability to make read speech sound
as if it is spontaneous. This is illustrated by Examples (13) and (14), excerpted from radio
announcements.
```
```
(13) a. This Saturday.
b. We’ll celebrate Presidents Day.
```
```
The prosody of (13) is produced with a restricted pitch range conveying a lack of emotional
involvement. Furthermore, both IUs end with sentence-final falling pitches. This prosodic
```

**253 10 Prosody**

```
Figure 10.18 Rising pitch with increasing emotional involvement
```
```
pattern conflicts with the celebratory sense of the phrases. Try saying (13) as if you really meant
it, not necessarily dividing it into these two parts. Then listen to how it was actually spoken.
By way of contrast, consider the excerpt in (14). The speaker here was skilled at sounding
spontaneous even though he had a script in front of him. He breaks the sentence into three
IUs, inserts the pause filler uh , and interrupts the third IU with a pause, as if he were search-
ing for words. This final IU shows an expanded pitch range. Again, try saying this sequence
yourself before listening to the way it was said by the broadcaster.
```
```
(14) a. Just park wherever you líke ,
b. and uh,
c. listen to ... a free cóncert.
These examples illustrate the considerable extent to which prosody contributes to the
effectiveness of speech. Pitch, volume, timing, and voice quality all play crucial roles in
expressing the active involvement of the speaker and in communicating emotional and
rhetorical impact to the listener.

### CHAPTER SUMMARY

```
Even detailed written transcriptions cannot fully represent all of the nuances of spoken
language; aural information is needed in order to capture the prosody as well. Prosody is
a cover term for variations in pitch, volume, timing, and voice quality. Writing systems
focus on segmental sounds and show prosody only in an impoverished manner. Prosody
is always present as an accompaniment to the segmental vowels, consonants, and
syllables of spoken language.
We have seen how prosody has multiple functions, one of which is to delimit linguistic units
such as IUs and sentences while signaling relations between them. At the same time, it allows
speakers to convey a variety of emotions and to direct their listeners’ attention to particularly
important parts of their utterances through prosodic distinctions of degrees of prominence.
Prosody thus serves both to organize and to evaluate the ideas conveyed by language.
Voice qualities such as creaky voice, harsh voice, laughing, whispering, and sobbing are
indicators of various emotional states. Manipulating prosody is an important component
of acting, as observable in theater, film, television, radio, and the oral reading of written
language of all kinds. Prosodic patterns can be characteristic of particular speech styles
and can be used to heighten the effectiveness of oratory. The prosody used in spoken
language, as speakers vary the rate, pitch, and volume of their speech, adds nuance and
meaning beyond what is conveyed by the words themselves.

    **iv.** State which part of the clip (which IUs) expressly conveys emotion. Then discuss how the speaker’s
       prosody accomplishes this.
**8.** Search YouTube for “Hamlet to Be or Not to Be.” You will find a set of video clips, each featuring a different
    actor producing the famous soliloquy. Choose three, and for each:
    **i.** State the name of the actor, provide the URL of the video clip, and the start and end times of the
       utterance _To be or not to be: That is the question._
    **ii.** Provide a detailed prosodic transcription. Note any changes in voice quality.
    **iii.** Describe the tempo of each clip and state which syllables are longest. Does the actor pause? If so,

### CHAPTER PREVIEW

```
This chapter focuses on language as a fundamentally social activity. All of the structural features
of language discussed in previous chapters can be used for important social functions. Because
language is the basis of human communication, it always occurs in a social context, and the
use of language both shapes and is shaped by social relationships, activities, structures, and
processes.
The chapter begins by considering differences within a single language as well as differences
between languages. We then consider two different social aspects of language: the creative
social positions that can be taken through language, and the rigid ideologies that circulate
regarding language and its users, which reproduce stereotypes and social inequality. The
chapter also discusses the role of linguistic activism in supporting social justice in and through
language.
```

11.1 **Introduction**

```
Hello. Hi.
G’day.
Good afternoon.
Hi there!
Hey.
Howdy!
How you doin’?
Whassup?
¡Hola!
```
```
Every day, in every encounter, from the very first moment you
begin to speak, you indicate something about yourself, your addressee, and your current
situation. In some sense, each of the utterances listed above “says the same thing”: each one
functions as a greeting. But from another perspective, these utterances say very different
things; they may be used by different kinds of speakers, to different kinds of addressees, and
in different speech situations (see Stop and Reflect 11.1).
```
### SIDEBAR 11.1

```
You can find definitions for key
terms and bolded terms throughout
this chapter in the Glossary (at the
back of this book or on the student
resources website). Additional online
resources for this chapter include
a study guide, review quiz, and
vocabulary quizzes.
```
### STOP AND REFLECT 11.1 THE SOCIAL MEANING OF GREETINGS

```
tWhich of these greetings would you use? To whom would you use each one? In what situations?
tWhat other greetings do you use that do not appear in this list? When and to whom do you use each one?
tWhich of the greetings would you never use? Who do you think uses them and in what situations?
```
```
You probably would not use all of the above greetings to all addressees, and you might
use some of them only in special situations. For instance, you might say Good afternoon
only in a formal context (depending on your age and geographic region), or perhaps you
would say Hi there! only to a young child. Even Hello , which English speakers often think of
as the most basic greeting, is likely to be something you use only to strangers or in formal
settings (or perhaps on the telephone). You might use some of the above greetings every
day, while you might never use others. And regardless of whether these greetings occur in
your own speech, you probably have ideas about the sort of speakers who use them: per-
haps, for example, you associate G’day with Australians and Whassup? with youth. Some of
these forms may also take on different meanings depending on who uses them. A bilingual
Mexican American student might use ¡Hola! with her friends to signal their shared identity,
```

**259 11 Language in the Social World**

```
while a white American student who doesn’t speak Spanish might use the same greeting
with her friends to show that she’s feeling light-hearted – although this sort of outgroup
use might be offensive to her Mexican American classmate. In each case, the language that
we use indicates to others how we want to be seen: as a member of various social groups
based on such factors as age, gender, sexuality, region, race, ethnicity, and so on, and also
as a particular kind of person within those groups. But of course listeners may or may not
go along with our self-representations. The examples above indicate that language does not
only convey information, nor does it only perform interactional functions such as greeting.
Our language also indicates how we see others and our relationship with them: friendly or
respectful, similar to us or different from us – imagine, for example, what would happen if
you greeted a close friend with a polite Good afternoon. Moreover, the way we speak indi-
cates how we understand our current social situation: formal
or casual, serious or playful. At the same time, language also
serves as a badge of identity – that is, the social positioning
of self and other. With every utterance, we display our own
identities and assign identities to other people, even when
we’re not talking about identity at all. In other words, language
involves both semantic meaning (what our words refer to) and
social meaning (what the linguistic choices we make communicate about us or how they
are perceived).
The discussion above also suggests that we have beliefs, impressions, and expecta-
tions about how we ourselves and others use language. We view certain linguistic
forms as characteristic of or appropriately used by some social groups and not others (see
Stop and Reflect 11.2).
```
### SIDEBAR 11.2

```
Social meaning is part of the broader
context that informs pragmatic
interpretation, the subject of Chapter 8.
```
### STOP AND REFLECT 11.2 GREETINGS AND SOCIAL EXPECTATIONS

```
tWhat sorts of greetings might be socially expected more from women than men? What sorts of greetings
might be seen as inappropriate for each gender?
tWhat sorts of greetings might be socially expected more from speakers from some racial or ethnic groups
rather than others? What sorts of greetings might be seen as inappropriate from members of each group?
```
```
Such social expectations are rarely completely accurate and often are entirely wrong. In
most cases, individual speakers’ language use is far more complex than we might expect
based on their group membership. For instance, many people think that women are more
likely than men to use polite greetings, but it is easy to find counterexamples to challenge
this notion. Our beliefs about language and language users are rarely neutral: we tend to
perceive some forms of language as “better” – more correct, more pleasant, more intelli-
gent-sounding – than others. For example, we might view greetings like Howdy or How you
doin ’? as less “correct” in some way than their counterparts How do you do? and How are you
doing? , but we might also feel that they sound friendlier than a more formal greeting. Such
beliefs are often strongly held and widely shared, and they have real-world consequences
for how speakers are perceived, but they are based in prescriptive attitudes, not descriptive
```

**260 Mary Bucholtz and Lal Zimman**

```
linguistic facts. From the viewpoint of linguists, all linguistic varieties (a cover term
that includes languages, dialects, and speech styles and registers) are equally grammatically
correct, cognitively complex, and sufficient for their users’ social purposes. In everyday life,
however, some forms of language are typically highly prized, while others are devalued.
Culturally shared ideas about language and its users that advantage some groups of speak-
ers over others are known as language ideologies. These ideologies play an important
role in reproducing social inequality in two interrelated ways. On the one hand, language
ideologies encourage listeners to accept without question that some ways of using language
are inferior to others; it is no coincidence that such ways of using language are mostly
associated with groups that are marginalized socially and politically. On the other hand,
language ideologies provide a kind of camouflage for discrimination against less powerful
groups. Racism, xenophobia, classism, sexism and misogyny, homophobia, transphobia,
and other forms of social inequality are all supported by ideologies that use language as a
stand-in for social differences. Those who espouse these ideologies may deny that they have
any prejudice or bigotry toward the group itself – but linguistic discrimination is discrimi-
nation nonetheless.
While language ideologies work to perpetuate the status quo, competing language ideol-
ogies that explicitly value and support the language use of less powerful groups can offer
a challenge to these dominant beliefs. For example,
in the hypothetical case described at the beginning
of this chapter, the Mexican American student may
negatively react to her white classmate’s playful use
of a Spanish greeting because Spanish speakers in the
United States have faced a long and ongoing history
of language-based discrimination and harassment.
Many speakers from oppressed groups may have an
ideology of linguistic ownership , which views certain ways of speaking (whether indi-
vidual words and phrases or entire languages) as cultural property that should not be lightly
used by outgroup members.
This chapter explores these two intertwined social aspects of language: language use as
a resource for displaying identity, and language ideologies as a means for reproducing or
resisting power. Both of these aspects of language crucially involve indexicality , or the
association of a linguistic form with a context-specific meaning ( to index literally means ‘to
point to’). The indexical meaning of any given linguistic form is not arbitrary or necessarily
agreed upon, but depends heavily on competing language ideologies that variously protect
and challenge the power of dominant groups.
```
11.2 **Linguistic Diversity and Language Variation**

```
The interdisciplinary field of sociocultural linguistics investigates the vast range of inter-
actional, social, cultural, and political (i.e., power-based) uses and meanings of language (the
term sociolinguistics is also sometimes used in this broad sense as well as to refer to a more
specific set of approaches to the study of language and society). The possibility of endowing
```
### SIDEBAR 11.3

```
For an example of how language
ideologies have shaped spelling
reform, see the Indonesian Language
Profile, Section 12.4.1.
```

**261 11 Language in the Social World**

```
language use with social meaning depends on having more than one way of “saying the same
thing,” and this in turn relies on two fundamental principles of sociocultural linguistics:
```
**1.** The principle of linguistic diversity: In most places around the world, it is typical and unre-
    markable for multiple languages to be used within a single community, by a single individ-
    ual, within a single interaction, and sometimes within a single utterance.
**2.** The principle of language variation: Variability is inherent in language; that is, it is normal
    and expected for speakers to speak in different ways due to social, situational, linguistic,
    and other factors.

```
As a result of these two principles, all speakers possess a wealth of linguistic resources for
carrying out their social and interactional goals in a variety of cultural contexts. However,
in some societies, dominant language ideologies reject these fundamental linguistic princi-
ples. Textbox 11.1 discusses one such ideology.
```
### TEXTBOX 11.1 THE MONOLINGUAL IDEOLOGY

```
In some countries, there is strong ideological resistance
to the principle of linguistic diversity, particularly
among people who speak only the politically dominant
language. The ability to speak only one language is
known as monolingualism. Although monolingualism
is relatively unusual around the world, in nations with a
strong monolingual ideology, speakers of nondominant
languages may face disapproval, discrimination, and
even criminalization. For example, in the United
States, people who publicly converse with friends
or family members in a language other than English
```
```
may be scolded by monolinguals who overhear them,
and workplaces may restrict employees’ use of other
languages among themselves, even when this enables
them to perform their work better. In several cases,
parents who speak languages other than English
have had their children removed from their care.
Such discriminatory policies and practices have been
ruled violations of civil rights by US courts. However,
monolinguals’ hostility to other languages remains a
serious social problem in the United States and some
other countries.
```
```
Even when a speaker is using the dominant language of a society, they cannot escape lan-
guage ideologies. Most obviously, the prescriptive ideology that many people encounter in
schools and other institutional contexts demands that all language users adhere to a single
standard variety, but this requirement violates the principle of language variation (see Stop
and Reflect 11.3).
```
### STOP AND REFLECT 11.3 LANGUAGE WITHOUT VARIATION?

```
Is it possible for everyone to speak exactly the same way? Is it possible for an individual to speak the same way
at all times? Is it desirable to do so? Before answering these questions, reflect on the role of language variation
in your own life.
tThink of someone with whom you regularly interact who speaks the same language very differently from
you. How would this person react if you tried to speak the way they did? How would you react if they tried
to speak the way you do?
tThink of two different situations in which the way you speak varies depending on where you are, what
you’re talking about, and/or who you’re talking to. How would people react if you didn’t vary your
language use across these situations?
```

**262 Mary Bucholtz and Lal Zimman**

```
Obviously, speakers of different languages communicate in different ways, but even when
speaking the same language, different kinds of people tend to speak differently, and speak-
ers who may seem to be quite similar socially do not always speak alike. Additionally, all
speakers vary their speech both across contexts and within the same context, for social as
well as linguistic reasons. For example, even in the same conversation a speaker might pro-
nounce the verbal suffix - ing sometimes as [ɪn] (as in I’m doin’ homework ) and sometimes as
[ɪŋ] (as in I’m formulating a hypothesis ). In other words, speakers can differ not only in their
use of an entire language or dialect but in their use of individual linguistic features , or
specific forms at any linguistic level. A linguistic feature might be the pronunciation of
a specific vowel or consonant (such as the pronunciation of the vowel in words like half
and bath with [ޝܤ] versus [æ]), the use of a particular grammatical structure (such as I’m not
versus I am not versus I ain’t ), a certain lexical choice (such as soda versus pop versus coke ),
or a particular interactional practice (such as allowing or avoiding overlap between speaker
turns). A key task of sociocultural linguistics is to systematically document these different
ways of speaking and to explain their interactional, social, cultural, and political functions
and meanings.
```
11.2.1 Linguistic Repertoires

```
One of the primary ways that individuals differ from one another with regard to language
is in their linguistic repertoires : the full range of linguistic varieties that they are able to
use to any degree. While in some communities most people are monolingual (see Textbox
11.1 above), most people in the world are multilingual and many communities around the
world involve multilingualism (that is, the use of two or more languages). It may seem that
those who know more than one language necessarily have wider repertoires than those who
do not, but even monolinguals have multiple ways of speaking (see Stop and Reflect 11.4).
```
### STOP AND REFLECT 11.4 LINGUISTIC REPERTOIRES

```
tWhat linguistic varieties (languages, dialects, styles) are in your own linguistic repertoire? When do you use
each one?
tHow does your repertoire compare to that of other members of your family?
tHow does your repertoire compare to that of other residents of your city or region?
tHow has your repertoire changed over time? How is it currently changing?
```
```
There may not be a widely recognized term for some of the varieties in your repertoire,
and you may have resorted to creative labels such as Chinglish (for a way of speaking that
combines elements of Chinese and English) or skater speak (for the way some speakers use
language when talking about skateboarding). Varieties that are associated with the spe-
cialized activities of particular groups are often termed registers. Some registers are pri-
marily used in professional or other formal settings, such as legal or religious contexts.
Others, like the skater register, are much more informal, but they also involve special ways
of speaking – in this case, related to the activity of riding a skateboard. Extremely informal
registers may include the extensive use of slang , a set of rapidly changing lexical items
```

**263 11 Language in the Social World**

```
often associated with youth and casual social contexts. Many nonlinguists incorrectly use
the term slang to refer to what are correctly termed dialects (or better, varieties ). This misuse
frequently reflects a language ideology that devalues varieties associated with socially mar-
ginalized groups. It is important to recognize that unlike slang, which primarily involves
the lexicon, all dialects also include phonology and grammar. Thus, to label a variety as
“slang” denies its structural complexity and systematicity.
```
```
11.2.2 Dialects and Style Shifting
Varieties considered to belong to the same language are often divided into dialects.
Traditionally, the term dialect refers to a variety of a language that is characteristic of a
group defined on the basis of a factor like geography (e.g., Egyptian Arabic), race or ethnic-
ity (e.g., Turkish German), or social class (e.g., Cockney, the working-class variety of English
spoken in London). Dialects are usually considered forms of the same language because
they are generally mutually intelligible. Linguists’ use of the terms language and dialect
therefore differs from the political (i.e., governmental) use of these terms. For example,
Hindi, spoken in India, and Urdu, spoken in Pakistan, are now considered separate lan-
guages for political reasons and are written with different writing systems, although the
spoken languages are mutually intelligible. Conversely, many languages of China, includ-
ing Mandarin, Cantonese, and others, are often called dialects despite being mutually unin-
telligible in their spoken form, because their speakers are politically unified under a single
government and they share a writing system. In addition, mutual intelligibility may be
asymmetrical due to such factors as status differences between varieties, greater media avail-
ability in one variety, and individuals’ motivation to communicate with the other group.
Thus, the distinction between a language and a dialect may be based on political or social
factors rather than on linguistic factors, and the linguistic criterion of mutual intelligibility
is not absolute. You may have discovered this for yourself if you have ever tried to speak to
someone with a very different dialect from your own.
Like slang , the label dialect is often misapplied in ways that reveal negative language ide-
ologies. Nonlinguists often erroneously apply the term dialect to languages without writing
systems, such as many indigenous languages of the Americas and Africa. This usage stems
from a colonial ideology that positions such languages as inferior to those with a written
tradition. The term dialect tends to be used for those varieties of a language that are less
prestigious due to the social devaluation of their speakers. But in fact everybody speaks
a dialect. You may think you do not speak a dialect because you perceive your way of
speaking as simply “normal,” but if you visit an area where another dialect is spoken you’ll
quickly discover that you’re the one perceived as speaking a dialect! Some speakers are
bidialectal (or multidialectal) – that is, fluent in two (or more) dialects – but no one has
mastery over every existing variety of a given language.
It is also important to distinguish dialects from accents. While a dialect is a complete
linguistic system that includes phonological, grammatical, and lexical characteristics, an
accent involves only the phonological characteristics of a given variety. Although we tend
to pay special attention to unfamiliar accents, there is no such thing as accentless speech.
Everyone has an accent – that is, everyone’s speech has a particular set of phonological
```

```
features. As with the issue of dialect, it is sometimes said that someone “has an accent”
when what is really meant is that the speaker’s phonology is noticeably different from that
of the observer or of the surrounding community. Thus, which dialects or accents count as
“normal” is a matter of social perception, not linguistic facts.
Some languages have a particular dialect that enjoys special status: the standard. The
standard is not simply one dialect among others but a different linguistic phenomenon
altogether. The standard is an artificial linguistic variety that has been deliber-
ately engineered to function as the prestige variety and typically also as a wider means
of written and spoken communication across social groups that
speak different dialects. Unlike most dialects, which emerge
from their everyday use by speakers, the standard is governed
by prescriptive rules that are codified in dictionaries and tradi-
tional grammar books and imposed by authorities through the
educational system and other means, often as a way to create a
national identity across different ethnic or cultural groupings.
The standard may be based on the speech of elites, or it may
be constructed out of several existing dialects, but strictly speaking, no one truly speaks
the standard , because it is more an idealization – or, more accurately, an ideological con-
struct – than a living variety.
One purpose of a standard is to freeze the language in place, but given the principle
of language variation, this is an unnatural and impossible goal. In any case, only a tiny
minority of the world’s languages has established a standard variety. Each English-speaking
country has developed its own unofficial standard, but if you compare the speech of elites
across the nation (such as members of Congress in the United States or news announcers
in Britain), you’ll find a wide range of variation, especially at the phonological and lexical
level. There are governmental or other entities that monitor language use, establish stand-
ard orthography (spelling), support the use of the standard, and
issue official pronouncements regarding which linguistic forms
are acceptable in institutional contexts such as the media and
education. Inevitably, however, in everyday speech these pol-
icies are often disregarded. Such organizations exist for a wide
range of languages. Although most focus on national and world
languages like Spanish, Turkish, and Mandarin Chinese, others
work to overcome a history of marginalization, as in the case of Haitian Creole, and/or to
revitalize endangered languages like Maori and Yiddish.
Linguists sometimes distinguish the standard, or prestige dialect, from the vernacular, or
nonstandard speech. For example, a great deal of sociolinguistic research has found that
middle-class speakers primarily use a more standard-like variety, while working-class speak-
ers use a more vernacular variety. In most situations, however, it is more useful to think of
the vernacular and the standard as varieties that are associated not simply with particular
social groups but also with particular social situations. This view focuses on the speaker’s
linguistic repertoire within a given language. From this perspective, the vernacular is the
variety of a language that a speaker uses for ordinary, everyday interaction, such as with

close family members and peers. One implication of this definition is that, as with dialects
and accents, every speaker has a vernacular ; for any given speaker, the vernacular may
be relatively standard or relatively nonstandard. While the vernacular is used in casual situ-
ations, in more formal contexts, speakers usually adjust their speech so that it more closely
approaches the standard. This phenomenon of alternating between different varieties or
styles of the same language based on the social context is termed style shifting.
Although all speakers regularly style-shift without conscious awareness, style shifting can
also be used more deliberately to achieve particular communicative effects. This use of style
shifting can be seen in the speech of Barack Obama. Both as a candidate and as president,
Obama demonstrated a high degree of linguistic flexibility, which enabled him to navigate
a difficult path as a Black politician who also needed to appeal to white voters.
When Obama was president-elect, he displayed this flexibility in a much-discussed inter-
action at a diner in Washington, DC. After Obama placed his order and paid the African–
American cashier twenty dollars, the cashier asked if he needed change. “Nah, we straight,”
he replied. This comment was perceived as a radical departure from Obama’s usual standard
English speech style not only because of the use of the slang term straight ‘even, square’
and the casual pronunciation of No as Nah , but also because it involved African–American
English grammar, specifically the zero copula , or the optional
absence of a copula form within a clause (compare We ’re straight
in other varieties of English). For Obama to style-shift in this
public context was likely not simply an automatic adjustment to
his setting and addressee but a deliberate indexing of his identity
to voters on the eve of his inauguration: both as a regular guy
who paid for his own lunch and generously tipped hard-working
Americans, and as an African American who was about to assume the most powerful office
in the world but had not forgotten his ties to the Black community.
```
```
11.2.3 Multilingualism and Codeswitching
In addition to variation within a single language, which is characteristic of all languages,
most communities also feature diversity across languages, with two, three, or more lan-
guages in regular use. Typically, these languages are not isolated from one another; rather,
speaking more than one language enables people to communicate with those around them.
Despite the monolingual ideology of the United States and most other English-speaking
nations, as well as Japan, Korea, France, and many others, multilingualism is far more typi-
cal than monolingualism around the world, and it is widespread even in supposedly mono-
lingual nations. India is an example of a highly multilingual nation, with over 400 living
languages representing four major language families. In addition to the two official lan-
guages, Hindi and English, India officially recognizes twenty-two regional languages. Most
speakers know at least two languages, and often more.
Multilingualism introduces an additional set of resources into speakers’ linguistic rep-
ertoires. In monolingual communities, linguistic repertoires are largely a matter of vari-
ation within a single language. In multilingual communities, a speaker’s repertoire may
include two or more languages, and people may also have facility in multiple varieties

within each of these languages. Some US Latinxs of Puerto Rican heritage, for example,
use Standard Puerto Rican Spanish, Nonstandard Puerto Rican Spanish, Standard American
English, Puerto Rican English, and sometimes other regional or ethnoracial dialects such
as New York English or African–American English as well. (Although for analytic purposes
linguists may distinguish all of these as separate varieties, they may not be neatly separated
from one another in practice, as discussed further below.) These varieties are all in wide use
in Puerto Rican communities in the mainland United States, but individual speakers may
have access to some varieties and not others depending on their background; for example,
Puerto Ricans educated in the mainland United States who experienced English-only educa-
tion may not have had the opportunity to learn spoken and written Standard Puerto Rican
Spanish.
In many multilingual communities, speakers use each language in a particular physical
context (e.g., English at work, Hindi at home). The use of two different languages or dialects
according to social domain is called diglossia. Unlike style shifting, which may occur in a
single situation based on topic or addressee, in diglossia, differ-
ent varieties are used in different situations. In reality, however,
the boundaries between domains often blur, and only in a few
situations is a language more or less fully circumscribed by a
specific domain of use. For instance, languages such as Classical
Arabic, Classical Hebrew, and Sanskrit are generally restricted to
religious or scholarly contexts. As these examples suggest, in addition to different languages
or dialects, diglossic situations also often involve special registers specific to each domain.
Multilingual speakers in many communities may have the additional ability to combine
the languages they speak through codeswitching , or the use of two or more languages
within a single interaction or utterance while conforming to the phonological and gram-
matical system of each language. A negative language ideology held by monolingual and
multilingual speakers alike views codeswitching as “impure” language use, or as a sign that
the speaker is not fluent in either language. The truth is that only speakers who are flu-
ent in two or more languages are able to engage in codeswitching. Example (1) pre-
sents two illustrations of codeswitching between Cantonese and English by young adults in
Hong Kong. Because of Hong Kong’s history as a British colony, college graduates are typi-
cally bilingual in English and Cantonese, the primary language of Hong Kong. (Following
the 1997 handover of Hong Kong to China, Mandarin has gained in prominence, and like
English it is spoken by about half the population.)

Codeswitching is triggered by multiple interactional factors, including the language used
by the previous speaker, the speaker’s goals (e.g., emphasis, disagreement), and the topic.
In addition, codeswitching is shaped by complex linguistic factors. Codeswitches are of
three general types: insertion (switching a lexical item within a single clause), alterna-
tion (switching between entire clauses), and tag switching (switching at a discourse
marker , a lexical item that is independent of the grammar of
the clause but performs discourse-level or interactional func-
tions). Because so many factors play a role in codeswitching, it is
difficult to predict when a switch will occur, but it is often pos-
sible to explain the function of a switch after the fact (see Stop
and Reflect 11.5).

```
```
Codeswitching should not be confused with types of language mixing that do not require
fluent bilingualism. One such phenomenon is interlanguage , a characteristic of nonflu-
ent language learners’ speech in which structural elements of the learner’s first language
and second language are combined due to the learner’s incomplete mastery of the second
language. As part of interlanguage, language learners may mix languages because they are
unable to sustain speech in their target language. Both structurally and functionally, code-
switching is entirely different from interlanguage. At the structural level, interlanguage
often co-occurs with nonnative features within the second language. At the functional level,
language learners use interlanguage because they lack sufficient knowledge of the target lan-
guage and must fall back on their first language. By contrast, bilingual speakers codeswitch
purposefully, if not fully consciously, to achieve a wide variety
of communicative goals, including to convey particular nuances
of meaning, to create social connection, and to structure their
discourse. Bilingual speakers sometimes report that they code-
switch because they can’t think of the right word in one of their

```
languages, but research demonstrates that this sort of codeswitching as a “crutch” is in fact
quite rare in fluent bilingual speech.
Another phenomenon that must be distinguished from codeswitching is lexical bor-
rowing , a process of adding new vocabulary to a language that does not require any abil-
ity in the source language at all (though bilinguals as well as monolinguals may engage in
lexical borrowing). Whereas in codeswitching, the phonological and grammatical systems
of both languages are kept separate as the speaker moves from one language to the other, in
lexical borrowing, the borrowed lexical item is fully integrated
phonologically and grammatically into the borrowing language.
For example, Spanish speakers in the United States often incor-
porate lexical borrowings or loanwords from English into
their speech, like lonche ‘lunch,’ parquear ‘to park,’ and yarda
‘yard.’ Conversely, monolingual English speakers use numer-
ous Spanish borrowings with English phonology and grammar, such as alligator (from el
lagarto ‘the lizard’) or burrito (literally, ‘little donkey’), pronounced in English as [b݋ޖԥiݐoݜ]
instead of Spanish [buޖrito]. Borrowing is a common result of linguistic and cultural contact
between groups, but unlike codeswitching it does not require fluent bilingualism or even
any knowledge of the language that is the source of the borrowing. (To explore codeswitch-
ing and borrowing further, see Stop and Reflect 11.6.)
```
### SIDEBAR 11.10

```
For more on borrowings, including
lexical borrowing, see Section 13.2.
```
### STOP AND REFLECT 11.6 CODESWITCH OR LOANWORD?

```
What would you want to know in order to determine whether the English lexical items in Example (1) above
are insertional switches or loanwords? In answering this question, consider how you know that a word such as
alligator or burrito in English is a loanword and not a switch.
When linguists analyze these phenomena, they consider criteria such as the following:
a. whether the words are pronounced according to the phonology of the source language (here, English) or
the target language (here, Cantonese);
b. whether the words are adapted into the grammatical structures of the target language;
c. whether the words are understood even by monolingual speakers of the target language;
d. whether the words are considered by the speakers themselves to be part of the target language.
(As it turns out, according to these criteria, all of the English words in Example (1) are part of codeswitching
rather than borrowing.)
```
```
Finally, it is important to realize that not all bilinguals are able to codeswitch, and not
all speakers who codeswitch do so in the same way. In Example (1a) above, Frank, who was
educated in Hong Kong and has a “local” identity, follows the insertional codeswitching
style typical of most young Hong Kongers. In Example (1b), Kelly, who was educated in the
United States during her teen years and then returned to Hong Kong, has a “returnee” iden-
tity and combines insertion switching with alternation switching and tag switching. This
returnee style of codeswitching is widely disparaged by local Hong Kongers as pretentious
and overly Western. In fact, in Example (1b) Kelly is describing the negative ideologies of
her local peers toward her returnee speech style. Although she tries to adapt to the local
codeswitching style in order to fit in and make friends, she is not always fully aware of her
switching (as is typical with codeswitching in general). And there is another reason why it
```

**269 11 Language in the Social World**

```
is difficult for Kelly to abandon her codeswitching style: it indexes her identity as a “world
citizen,” as she puts it.
As Kelly’s situation demonstrates, how we use language is intimately tied to our identi-
ties, yet the identity we seek to project through language may not be what others perceive,
depending on their own language ideologies.
```
```
11.2.4 From Codeswitching to Translanguaging
Although sociocultural linguistics provides analytic tools for identifying the contributions
of different languages to interactions like Example (1), most of the time speakers are not
focused on linguistic boundaries. Instead, speakers draw on their full linguistic repertoires
to the extent possible in a given social context in order to achieve their communicative
goals. In the case of bilingual speakers who engage in complex codeswitching practices,
it has been argued that rather than trying to account for the function of each individual
switch or seeking to classify a given term as a switch or a borrowing, linguists should rec-
ognize codeswitching or code mixing itself as a separate linguistic variety. In fact, bilin-
gual speakers often do just that by coining terms such as Spanglish (Spanish and English),
Franglais (French and English), and Portuñol or Portunhol (Portuguese and Spanish).
Some researchers take this idea even further, pointing out that speakers’ linguistic reper-
toires are made up of specific linguistic features that may not necessarily coincide with the
boundaries between recognized languages and dialects. In any case, it is often not possible
to draw sharp boundaries between linguistic varieties, as seen
in the earlier discussion of languages and dialects. Thus some
researchers have argued for conceptualizing blended language
practices as translanguaging , or a speaker’s use of features
from their linguistic repertoire as a unified whole, regardless of
the source of these features from a linguistic standpoint. On the
one hand, translanguaging may be seen as a broader concept
that includes style shifting, codeswitching, lexical borrowing,
interlanguage, and more. On the other hand, it offers an alter-
native to all of these concepts by examining language use from
a unitary perspective rather than focusing on linguistic boundaries. In this way, the con-
cept of translanguaging challenges linguists’ own language identities by reminding us that
what we call languages and dialects aren’t straightforward linguistic realities but
are social and political constructs that may not reflect speakers’ own identities as
language users.
```
```
11.2.5 Linguistic Activism and Sociolinguistic Justice
As we have seen, language users from many different nondominant groups are frequent
targets of negative language ideologies. One way that linguists combat these ideologies is by
carrying out and sharing scientific research that corrects these widespread misperceptions.
However, because language ideologies aren’t fundamentally about language but about
struggles between powerful and subordinated social groups, simply doing good research
isn’t enough. For this reason, a growing number of linguists – including many sociocultural

linguists – engage in linguistic activism , or direct action to challenge language-based
social inequality. These linguists often work in partnership with – and frequently as mem-
bers of – communities facing linguistic oppression, such as immigrant groups, indigenous
communities, and groups with marginalized racial, ethnic, sexual, gender, or religious
identities. Linguistic activism can involve advocating for more equitable institutional pol-
icies and practices, supporting speakers’ use of their full linguistic repertoires, ensuring
that language accurately reflects individual and group identities, and preserving varieties
threatened by dominant languages (see Textbox 11.2). The goal of this activist work is
sociolinguistic justice , or self-determination for linguistically subordinated individuals
and groups in struggles over language. In the next section, we will further explore issues of
identity, ideology, and social inequality in relation to language.

11.3 **Variation, Ideology, and Identity**

```
Unlike switching between languages, which is often very noticeable to others, most varia-
bility within an individual language is not noticed at all. It is impossible to produce a given
utterance, word, or even phoneme in exactly the same way each time we speak, and this
constant linguistic variability goes unremarked most of the time. Yet all speakers constantly
use variation to position themselves as particular kinds of people, to take specific stances
in interactions with others, and to establish certain kinds of relationships. As a result, a
particular social meaning often comes to be attached to a particular linguistic form. A lin-
guistic feature that varies either across speakers or in the speech of a single speaker is called
a socio linguistic variable , and the alternate forms that this variable takes in speech are
called sociolinguistic variants. Over time, some variants may catch on while others
disappear. Through this process, variation is the source of language change.
An illustration of the relationship between linguistic variation, language change, and
social meaning can be seen in the case of the pronunciation of /r/ after a vowel, or post-
vocalic /r/ , in the history of English, as described by researcher Thomas Paul Bonfiglio.
The rhotic variant of postvocalic /r/ is pronounced as [ɹ], while the nonrhotic variant
is pronounced as a vowel. In unstressed syllables this vowel is often [ə], as in better [ޖbɛɾə]
```

**271 11 Language in the Social World**

```
(or [ޖbܭtԥ], depending on the dialect), while in stressed syllables the vowel is an offglide or
lengthening of the preceding vowel, as in car [kޝܤހ]. In the eighteenth century the nonrhotic
pronunciation emerged in Cockney, the variety of the London working class. This pro-
nunciation, though initially stigmatized, eventually became trendy among the middle and
upper classes of London and among American elites on the East Coast and in the South who
emulated English fashions. Until the early twentieth century, the US Midwestern rhotic
pronunciation was often seen by nonrhotic speakers as provincial and harsh or aggressive.
But the indexicality of rhoticity in the United States changed with the arrival of Eastern
and Southern European immigrants in East Coast cities and the northern migration of
African Americans, all of whom used the nonrhotic pronunciation. Owing to racism, this
form took on a new, negative meaning in the eyes of the middle-class white population.
Consequently, the rhotic pronunciation associated with white Midwesterners gained sta-
tus. The nonrhotic pronunciation continues to decline in the United States even among
groups that have traditionally used it, despite remaining prestigious in much of the English-
speaking world.
The example of postvocalic /r/ illustrates several important points regarding language
variation:
```
**1.** The speech of non-elite groups, not the elite, drives linguistic innovation and change.
**2.** Linguistic variation leads to systematic changes in the language when certain sociolinguis-
    tic variants gain ground over alternatives.
**3.** Sociolinguistic variants often come to index particular social groups and their ideologically
    associated traits, enabling speakers to use those variants to stake out specific identities.
**4.** A sociolinguistic variant may have different indexicalities for different groups or in differ-
    ent contexts, and indexicalities also change over time.
**5.** Linguistic forms do not have any inherent social meaning or social value. Instead, their
    status is based on how the speakers who use them are socially perceived and evaluated.

```
Language variation and change, then, are closely connected to processes of social identity,
cultural ideology, and power and inequality.
The relationship between language and identity has been understood in different ways
within different strands of sociocultural linguistics. In the correlationist tradition,
researchers have sought to discover the social meaning of linguistic structures by finding
correlations between social categories and the use of particular sociolinguistic variants.
From this perspective, language reflects social identities: we
speak as we do because of who we are. For example, linguists
have long known that working-class speakers are more likely
than middle-class speakers to use [ɪn] rather than [ɪŋ] in verb
forms like talking, running , and sleeping. In this approach, speak-
ers’ social categories are used to predict which linguistic forms
they will use and to explain why they made these choices. In
the correlationist view, language is seen as reflecting social identities: the starting point of
linguistic analysis in this approach is speakers’ social category membership, which is used
to explain a given linguistic phenomenon.
```
### SIDEBAR 11.12

For more on the ways language
variation and change are connected
to processes of social identity and
cultural ideology, see Chapter 13.
```

**272 Mary Bucholtz and Lal Zimman**

```
However, many sociocultural linguists now see the relationship between language and
identity from the reverse perspective. Rather than using social categories to explain lan-
guage, we can look to language use to gain insight into how people want to be perceived by
others. According to the constructionist view, language creates social identities. By
speaking in particular ways (such as by saying runnin’ more often than running ), we index
our identities as particular kinds of people (such as working-class rather than middle-class),
and those who hear us speak make inferences about our background, our abilities, and even
our personalities based on the linguistic forms we use.
These inferences may either support or undermine our own goals for how we wish to be
seen, since both speakers and hearers are actively engaged in how language is used and socially
interpreted. In addition, language is not understood simply as a mirror reflecting preexisting
categories of identity to which the speaker passively belongs. Instead, language is a vehicle for
social action, as speakers use linguistic structures to lay claim to a desired set of social charac-
teristics and listeners accept or challenge these identity claims. In this process, speakers and
hearers rely on culturally shared understandings of how various social groups speak.
```
11.3.1 Language, Gender, and Sexuality

```
The tension between identity and ideology in language use is especially evident in the lin-
guistic study of gender and sexuality. Research in this area has been closely connected to
the work of activists concerned with gender inequality in language. The feminist study of
language and gender was established in the midst of the women’s movements of the 1970s,
and early research focused on critical analyses of androcentrism, a perspective that treats
men as the default, unmarked type of human. One way in which androcentrism is reflected
and reinforced linguistically is the use of the generic masculine , in which a masculine
linguistic form is used to refer to an unspecified person or group, as exemplified in older
expressions like Man’s inhumanity to man and To each his own. Some English speakers con-
tinue to prefer he as a generic pronoun (rather than she, they , or she or he ), despite objections
that such language marginalizes those who don’t identify as male.
The generic masculine is widespread in languages with grammatical gender , a system for
categorizing nouns into two, three, or more classes which are marked by grammatical agree-
ment on words of other categories. (For languages with many such classes, the term “noun
class” is typically used rather than “grammatical gender.”) Grammatical gender systems gener-
ally place women in one class and men in another, with the social
expectation that so-called feminine forms will be used in reference
to women and masculine forms in reference to men. The generic
masculine is found in languages like French, Hebrew, and Hindi,
where masculine grammatical forms are used for nonspecific ref-
erents and when referring to groups of mixed gender. It is rare for
a language to use generic feminine forms, although some examples exist, such as Tunisian
Arabic. And linguistic innovations have been proposed to avoid gender marking altogether (as
illustrated by the use of Latinx instead of the generic masculine form Latino in this chapter).
While struggles over the generic masculine are ongoing, in English generic masculine forms
are becoming much less common, as gender-neutral substitutes have been made (e.g., com-
mittee chair replacing committee chairman ). Other relatively successful gender-related language

### TEXTBOX 11.3 “WOMEN’S LANGUAGE”: LANGUAGE IDEOLOGY OR LINGUISTIC

### REALITY?

```
A much-discussed book by Robin Lakoff, originally
published in 1975, proposed that women’s language
is characterized by features of what she considered
powerless speech, including the following:
```
1. Special terminology related to “women’s work”
    such as color terms like _magenta_ or words related to
    activities like sewing.
2. “Empty” adjectives like _divine, charming, cute_ , etc.
3. Indicators of questions on declarative utterances:
    tag questions (“It’s so hot, isn’t it?”) and rising
    intonation in statement contexts (“What’s your
    name, dear?” “Mary Smith?”)
4. Hedges like _well, y’know, kinda_ , etc.
5. The use of intensifier _so_
6. Hypercorrect grammar
    7. Superpolite forms
    8. Women don’t tell jokes
    9. Women speak in italics [i.e., use frequent emphatic
       stress]
          (Lakoff [1975] 2004: 78–81)
Other researchers sought to test these claims
    in the speech of women and men, with mixed
    results. Linguists now understand that the notion of
    **“women’s language”** is not necessarily a description
    of the speech of all (or most, or any) women, but
    rather a language ideology regarding how women are
    expected to speak – or suffer the social consequences
    if they do not. Lakoff herself recognized the ideological
    power of “women’s language” in restricting women’s
    behavior and opportunities. It may seem that this
    decades-old ideology is no longer relevant, and it

Language change often occurs without speakers’ awareness, but when language perpetuates problematic
ideologies, people may take an active interest in changing how we use it. Think about the following
examples:
tSome speakers use the word bitch as a verb meaning ‘complain.’ It is also used as a derogatory term for a
woman. Some people see both uses of bitch as contributing to sexism against women.
tThe use of they as a generic pronoun to refer to a single person has a long history in English, including
use by celebrated authors such as Jane Austen, Lewis Carroll, and William Shakespeare. Prescriptivists may
argue that singular they is ungrammatical and should not be used, but some individuals with trans and/or
nonbinary gender identities identify with the pronoun they rather than she or he.
tOver the past century, the word gay has shifted from meaning ‘happy’ to being the most common term to
refer to people (especially men) who are attracted to others of the same gender. Following that change, the
word began to be used by younger speakers as a general term of negative evaluation (e.g., That’s so gay ,
meaning ‘That’s stupid/uncool’).
What arguments might language activists make in response to these issues? Why do you think these
debates become intensely heated? Would a sociocultural linguist be more likely to see these as matters of
prescriptivism or of sociolinguistic justice?
```
```
Early feminist linguists argued that gender inequality in language arises not only in gram-
mar but also in how women and men speak, or at least in how they are thought to speak
(see Textbox 11.3).
```

**274 Mary Bucholtz and Lal Zimman**

```
Many ideologies about supposed differences in the language use of women and men focus
on discourse practices. These ideologies portray women as more cooperative, social, and
attuned to their interlocutors’ needs, while men are characterized as competitive, informa-
tive, and attuned to their interlocutors’ status. For example, men are often said to interrupt
more often than women because of their need to demonstrate dominance. Women, by
contrast, are frequently said to talk more than men because of their interest in building
and maintaining social relationships. Although there are certainly women and men whose
behavior seems to fit these expectations, empirical study presents a more complex picture.
Comparing whether women or men talk more, for instance, requires us to decide how to
quantify speech – for instance, do we count the number of words used, the amount of time
spent speaking, how many separate ideas are expressed, or how many turns a person takes
in a conversation? Next, we need to decide whether to account for differences in the type
of talk – for instance, do supportive comments like “mhm,” “I see,” and “wow” inserted
into another person’s stream of talk count in the same way a statement expressing new
information would? Furthermore, we have to consider how the context of our observations
plays a role in the results; when people claim that women talk more, they tend to have in
mind social peers engaging in intimate conversations, not necessarily the more formal,
institutionalized talk that happens in classrooms, boardrooms, or courtrooms. Often what
researchers of language, gender, and sexuality find is not that women speak one way and
men speak another, but that women and men are often inclined – or permitted – to do
different things with language in different contexts because of differences in gender-based
power (consider, for example, Hillary Clinton’s language during her 2016 US presidential
campaign versus Donald Trump’s language).
```
```
is certainly true that some of the characteristics of
conventionally feminine language use have changed
over time, as cultural ideologies of femininity have
```
```
changed. However, ideologies about how women and
men “should” speak and act are still with us, as is the
underlying ideology of gender as fixed and binary.

association persist?

```

**275 11 Language in the Social World**

```
Despite such ideologies about how women and men speak (or should speak), there is in
fact a great deal of variability in the speech of each gender and a great deal of similarity
across the genders. Even when linguists do feel able to make generalizations about gender,
these are by no means straightforward: For example, correlationist studies have found that
women lead sound changes by making greater use of innovative vernacular variants, but
that they often have more conservative, standard speech when it comes to stigmatized
vernacular variants.
Ultimately, though, it is almost impossible to generalize about how women or men
speak. This is because gender looks – and sounds – very different depending on how it
intersects with other identities like sexual orientation, ethnicity and race, or socioeconomic
class. What it means to be a person with a particular gender identity, a person of color, or
a teenager differs substantially depending on the multiple communities and identities that
speakers negotiate as well as the experiences of power or oppression associated with those
identities. An individual’s or group’s experience of multiple simultaneous forms of margin-
alization and oppression based on social categories is known as intersectionality , and
this experience may affect language production and perception. (Textbox 11.4 on p. 278
provides an example of intersectionality.) An intersectional perspective on identity moves
us away from the quest for differences between women and men and toward a more holistic
and contextualized view of speakers’ identities.
```
```
11.3.2 Styles and Communities of Practice
The shift from correlationist to constructionist perspectives on language and gender has
led to changes in the way sociocultural linguists think about variation. Older models of
style shifting and language change framed variability as largely determined by a speaker’s
demographics along with factors such as social context, but today sociocultural linguists
tend to be more attuned to the way speakers exert agency by making linguistic choices that
position them socially.
Demographic categories like gender are central to how we are perceived by others,
but more important to our own identities and hence to our language use are the social
groupings that we orient to in everyday life. These social groupings are sometimes termed
communities of practice , or social groups that jointly engage in culturally meaningful
activities. Communities of practice include families, friendship groups, teams and clubs,
professional and community-based organizations, and any other group that undertakes a
shared effort. In accounting for speakers’ language use, membership in different commu-
nities of practice may override shared demographic membership. Thus the community of
practice model helps us understand why it is so difficult to make generalizable claims about
whether women tend to be more standard or more vernacular than men.
For example, a classic study done by Penelope Eckert in the 1980s in a largely white
suburban high school near Detroit, Michigan, found a sharp distinction between “jocks”
and “burnouts.” Jocks were clean-cut, dressed in bright or pastel colors and trendy
“preppy” styles, were college-bound, and participated in sports, student council, and other
school-sponsored activities. Meanwhile, burnouts wore non-trendy dark clothing, were
rebellious or disengaged from school, smoked cigarettes, and planned to find jobs in the
```

**276 Mary Bucholtz and Lal Zimman**

```
local community after high school. Linguistically, burnouts used more nonstandard gram-
mar (specifically, negative concord , or the marking of negation in more than one possi-
ble grammatical position, as in They didn’t never do nothing to help ), and they also outpaced
the jocks in some elements of a sound change in progress in the vowel system of the Detroit
area. Previous correlationist studies of variation and language change would lead us to
expect that girls would be leading this sound change while boys would make more frequent
use of negative concord. However, the way these variables patterned with respect to gen-
der ended up interacting with the locally meaningful categories of jock and burnout. For
example, it was the “burned-out burnout girls” (that is, girls who got into the most trouble
at school) who were the most advanced participants in some parts of the sound change,
particularly the raising of the central vowel in the diphthong /aɪ/. The most extreme raised
variant is [ʌɪ], so that fight sounds almost like “foight” and all-nighter sounds similar to “all-
noighter” (a slang term used by burnouts to refer to staying out all night partying). The
female jocks, while they led the sound change relative to male jocks, made much less use of
the innovative variant than either female or male burnouts.
Figure 11.1 presents in visual form the correlation of combined speaker gender and social
category with the extreme raising of /aɪ/. The numbers, derived from statistical calculations
that are widely used for analyzing sociolinguistic variation, are probability values for the
use of the innovative raised pronunciation by each group of speakers. Numbers above 0.5
indicate that the change is favored in that group; numbers below 0.5 indicate that the
change is disfavored in that group. The differences between the five speaker groups are all
highly statistically significant.

```

**277 11 Language in the Social World**

```
The figure shows that jocks mostly tended not to use the new pronunciation, regard-
less of gender, and that among the burnouts, most girls had a slight tendency to avoid it.
Even burnout boys as a group only slightly favored the innovative variant. By contrast, the
burned-out burnout girls were the clear leaders in the use of raised /aɪ/. It seems that this
variant was especially important for burned-out burnout girls in indexing a tough, rebel-
lious identity. It isn’t that the burnout girls were less feminine than the female jocks – or,
for that matter, than the male jocks. Rather, they were adhering to a different set of local
norms for how girls should speak.
The example of the jocks and burnouts demonstrates that although we may be tempted to
sort speakers into simple demographic boxes, such as “white suburban high school girl” or
“African–American lesbian professional,” speakers often work hardest to distinguish them-
selves from others to whom they seem similar. This is shown in a study of sociolinguistic
variation among Beijing professionals in the 1990s, as China shifted toward a global mar-
ket economy. State employees tended to use local phonological variants, including adding
a rhotic quality to syllable-final vowels, a feature that indexed a smooth, streetwise identity.
Meanwhile, employees of similar backgrounds with equivalent positions at transnational cor-
porations used full tones in unstressed syllables, a characteristic of the Hong Kong and Taiwan
dialects of Mandarin but not of Beijing Mandarin; this feature was viewed by locals as a cos-
mopolitan, “yuppie” way of speaking. Such research shows that it is largely through their lan-
guage use that seemingly similar groups are able to differentiate themselves from one another.
```
### STOP AND REFLECT 11.9 COMMUNITIES OF PRACTICE

```
tWhat local communities of practice were important in your own high school or in the town or city where
you grew up? Did any communities of practice define themselves partly in contrast to other groups?
tHow did members of each group index their identities both linguistically and in other ways (such as
clothing, activities, or attitudes)?
tHow did people change community of practice membership or manage to belong to multiple communities
of practice at the same time?
```
```
Linguistic researchers of communities of practice do not simply focus on language use.
They also examine such issues as how speakers dress, what activities they engage in, their
goals and attitudes, and their orientation to larger social and cultural forms (e.g., school,
global culture). In short, they look broadly at the locally available categories of style , or
socially distinctive ways of doing things. Communities of practice are often characterized
by distinctive styles. Although clothing, activities, attitudes, and the like are all important
dimensions of style, language is an especially valuable resource for aligning oneself with
some social groups and distinguishing oneself from others. Every aspect of the way we
talk indexes information about our identities. At the same time, this information is
not accessible to everyone. The social meaning of our style often requires insider knowl-
edge – such as residence in a local community or attendance at a particular high school – in
order to be correctly recognized and interpreted. The issue of interpretation is especially
important given the multiple social meanings that a linguistic form can index.
```

**278 Mary Bucholtz and Lal Zimman**

11.3.3 Stances, Personas, and Identities

```
Although social categories like race and ethnicity, gender, and sexuality are constructed
through language use, speakers do not make their linguistic choices simply to signal that
they are women, that they are in their forties, that they come from a working-class family,
or that they are bisexual. More often, speakers are focused on how to position themselves
at multiple levels within specific interactions.
To begin with, depending on the situation and the other participants, we enact a vari-
ety of social and cultural roles, such as teacher, sibling, or best friend. The relational
roles we perform imply a certain set of social rights, obligations, relationships, and areas
of expertise that influence the way we speak in particular contexts. Moreover, through-
out social interaction we rapidly take up and abandon temporary roles such as narrator,
joke-teller, or question-answerer. These interactional roles allow us to engage in spe-
cific linguistic activities within social interaction. In addition, each time we speak we
also position ourselves toward what we are saying and toward our interlocutors. Such
positionings, or stances , linguistically enact our attitude at any given moment. Finally,
through the way we enact all of these categories, community memberships, roles, and
stances we create personas (or personae). Personas are social types associated with
specific personal attributes and/or broader social groups. For example, we may present
ourselves as “bubbly,” “aggressive,” or “laid-back,” attributes that may be ideologically
associated with social groups like “cheerleader,” “lawyer,” or “hippie,” which in turn
may be tied to locally meaningful styles or broader social categories of race, gender, social
```
### TEXTBOX 11.4 THE INTERSECTION OF SEXUALITY AND IMMIGRATION IN

### DANISH

```
Sociocultural linguists are interested in both the
production and the perception of social meaning. One
area of particular interest to perception researchers
is sexuality. Speakers of several languages, including
English, Spanish, Japanese, and Danish, have been
shown to be more likely to view men as gay if they
produce /s/ with a slightly fronted place of articulation
compared to men who are perceived as straight. (This
perception is associated with the widespread ideology
that gay men have a distinctive “lisp,” although a
fronted pronunciation is not the same as lisping.)
However, the connection between sexuality and /s/ is
complicated when we consider how sexuality intersects
with other aspects of identity. In Danish, a fronted
/s/ indexes not only gay men but also speakers of a
variety known as “street Danish” that is associated with
immigrant youth. In a tightly controlled experiment,
a team of Danish linguists found that listeners were
more likely to hear a speaker of standard Copenhagen
```
```
Danish as “gay” when a fronted /s/ was present.
However, for listeners who thought they were listening
to a speaker of “street Danish” (based on a distinctive
type of intonation used in that variety), the presence
of a fronted /s/ had no effect on the perception of
the speaker’s sexuality. In short, the perception of a
variant as having a specific social meaning (such as
“gay”) depends on the other linguistic features that
accompany it.
It appears that these listeners were influenced by
social ideologies about sexuality, race and ethnicity,
and immigration. In Denmark (and most Western
nations), the prototypical gay person is a white non-
immigrant. This perception is due to listeners’ failure to
consider the possibility of an intersectional identity – for
instance, that a speaker could be both gay and an
immigrant. Lack of awareness of intersectionality may
make it more difficult for listeners to hear the voice of
an immigrant as the voice of a gay man.

```
class, and the like. Speakers can index many different kinds of identity all at the same
time: demographic categories, styles based in local communities of practice, relational
social and cultural roles, interactional roles, stances, and personas. This wide range of
identity positions necessarily requires speakers to use an equally wide range of linguistic
(as well as nonlinguistic) resources to index themselves as particular kinds of people in a
given situation.
This point is illustrated in a case study of the speech of a gay white American medical
student, Heath. Heath’s use of a falsetto (i.e., extremely high-pitched) voice quality for
expressive purposes was measured in three different social contexts: with his friends at
a barbecue, on the telephone with his father, and during a medical consultation with an
elderly patient. The results showed that Heath’s speech to his friends involved a falsetto
voice that was not only more frequent than in other contexts (see Table 11.2), but also of
longer duration and of broader pitch variability, and used in a wider variety of utterance
types. The researcher argued that Heath uses falsetto to create a flamboyant “diva” persona
but that he does so not simply because he is gay – after all, many gay men do not adopt
this sort of persona, and Heath himself does not always do so. Rather, the use of falsetto to
construct a diva persona is specific to this particular speaker in a particular context. Identity,
then, is not simply a static category but an ever-changing image that we produce through
language and other practices.
```
```
TABLE 11.1 Frequency of falsetto occurrence in Heath’s speech across situations (adapted from
Podesva 2007: 486)
```
```
Barbecue Phone Patient
Number of falsetto utterances 35 10 15
Total number of utterances 386 260 403
```
```
Percent falsetto utterances 9.07 3.85 3.72
```
```
All of the categories, styles, roles, stances, and personas we inhabit, whether temporary
or more durable, together constitute our identities, because they comprise the variety of
ways that we position ourselves and are positioned by others within the social world. Thus,
although identity is often thought of as a psychological phenomenon, it is more fundamen-
tally a social and interactional process, constructed and negotiated every time we engage
with others, based on our own and others’ language ideologies. A speaker may say talkin ’
instead of talking in order to sound casual but instead be perceived as uneducated; they may
swear to convey strong feeling and instead be perceived as unladylike (if female-identified)
or as appropriately tough and masculine (if male-identified); they may use translanguag-
ing practices in order to show solidarity with other bilinguals and instead be perceived as
unable to speak either language well. Sociocultural linguistics offers us a wealth of analytic
concepts and tools for closely examining language as perhaps the most basic and pervasive
way that we display identity.
```

### CHAPTER SUMMARY

```
Language is more than a tool for communicating information or accomplishing
immediate interactional goals; it is also a resource for creating social meaning, a
marker of who we are and how we want to be seen by others, and a site of struggles
for power on the one hand and social justice on the other. In this chapter, we have
seen that the principle of linguistic diversity and the principle of language variation
together make possible the numerous social functions that language plays in our lives.
Linguistic resources may be used to position the speaker as a particular kind of person
in a particular social context. Likewise, language may be used to display social identities
at multiple levels, from brief interactional stances to more enduring personas and
categories. However, as speakers we are not entirely free to create whatever identity we
want using whatever kind of language we want. We are constrained by our own linguistic
repertoires, as well as by language ideologies that may lead others to interpret our
language use negatively or inaccurately. At the same time, language ideologies are not
entirely rigid and can be challenged or changed through individual and collective action.
In so doing, we create new ways of linguistically positioning ourselves and others within
our social worlds.

    **f.** the use of slang from LGBT communities of color (e.g. _throw shade_ , ‘criticize or insult someone, usually
       indirectly’) by white straight fans of the US reality television show _RuPaul’s Drag Race_
**6.** Table 11.2 shows a partial selection of first-person and second-person pronouns used in Japanese, a
    language in which pronouns are typically grammatically optional. Take note of the different meanings
    associated with each pronoun.
    **i.** Compare the Japanese pronoun system with the pronoun system in English or another language that
       you know. What kind of information is encoded or omitted in each system?
    **ii.** What social functions do pronouns seem to play for speakers of Japanese compared to speakers of the
       other language? Given that pronouns are often optional in Japanese, why do speakers use them at all?
    **iii.** What are some possible social or cultural reasons the Japanese pronoun system works the way it does?
       What kinds of linguistic reform might some speakers advocate?
**7.** Not all speakers of languages with grammatical gender adhere to the norm of mapping grammatical gender
    onto social gender. One example of a group that alternates between feminine and masculine grammatical
    forms is a transgender group in India known as hijras. Hijras are typically assigned to the male gender at
    birth but describe their identities and bodies as neither female nor male. Hindi, one of the languages spoken
    by hijras, has extensive grammatical gender marking. Although hijras usually use feminine grammatical
    forms for themselves, at times they refer to themselves or one another with masculine forms.

YouTube “Barack Obama’s Presidential Announcement”
```
**8.** As noted in the chapter, politicians often provide interesting illustrations of language variation. For this
    activity, you will view Barack Obama’s 2007 announcement of his candidacy for president. This speech
    took place in Springfield, the capital of Illinois; at the time, Obama was an Illinois senator. Read through
    the instructions and view the first two minutes or so of the speech, from approximately 0:46 to 2:49. As
    you listen, notice when Obama style-shifts between standard English and a more colloquial speech style.
    Pay particular attention to his pronunciation of _you_ and his pronunciation of the morpheme - _ing_. Then
    answer the questions below.
    **i.** What variation did you notice in Obama’s pronunciation of _you_? Phonetically transcribe each variant,
       and for each variant, give at least two examples of utterances where it occurs.
    **ii.** What variation did you notice in Obama’s pronunciation of _-ing_? Phonetically transcribe each variant,
       and for each variant, give at least two examples of utterances where it occurs.
    **iii.** What appears to be the function of these shifts? That is, why does Obama shift at these points and
       what social effect does his style shifting have?
    **iv.** Does Obama shift into African–American English or another variety? Why do you think he used
       this variety rather than another in this context? (Hint: Consider his use of other variables, such as
       postvocalic /r/.)
**9.** The study of linguistic landscapes – the use of multiple linguistic varieties in public signage – is a valuable
    way to gain insight into language ideologies. For this activity you will document the linguistic landscape
    of your own community by photographing linguistically interesting signs using a smartphone or camera.
    Depending on whether your community is multilingual or monolingual, you may focus on signage in
    multiple languages, multiple varieties of the same language, or both. Some signs may be monolingual
    while others may involve some form of translanguaging.
    **i.** For each sign you photograph, make a note of where the sign was located, what it was communicating,
       and who the target audience seemed to be.
    **ii.** For each sign, what may have motivated the linguistic choices of the sign’s creator?
    **iii.** For each sign, what language ideology underlies its use of language? (This might be an ideology
       discussed in the chapter or another that you identify and describe.)
**10.** Think about the following ideologies about gender differences in language, and brainstorm other
    ideologies about language and gender in your own communities of practice. How would you go about
    testing their accuracy? Use the chapter’s discussion of whether women or men talk more as a starting
    point.
    **a.** Men interrupt their interlocutors more often than women do.
    **b.** Women talk about their feelings more than men do.
    **c.** Men tend to dominate discussions in workplace meetings.
    **d.** Women are more polite than men.
    **e.** In interactions between heterosexual partners, men are more likely to choose the topics of conversation.
**11.** Consider some issue of inequitable language use that concerns or affects you. This may be the use of
    gendered nouns or pronouns, as discussed in the chapter, the use of words and expressions that have their
    roots in offensive stereotypes (such as _gyp_ from _Gypsy_ , referring to the Roma people, or words for mental
    illness like _mad_ or _crazy_ used to express intensity), controversial social group labels (such as _Hispanic_ ), or
    some other issue. How might you design a linguistic activism project to address this problem in your local
    community or more broadly? What challenges might you confront, and how would you address objections
    to your proposed reform?

### CHAPTER PREVIEW

```
In previous chapters, we have talked about languages of the world and how they have
different ways of expressing similar meanings. We have also examined various specific aspects
of linguistic structure, including phonology, morphology, and syntax. But how did these
structures within each language come to be? And how do languages come to be so different
from each other?
This chapter describes how languages evolve over time: how sounds can shift, how sound
systems can be restructured, and how grammar develops. It then discusses genealogical
relationships among languages and how they can be detected. It closes with a glimpse
of what reconstructed languages can tell us about their speakers. An important aspect of
language change is the fact that it is not arbitrary; it is the result of acts of speakers, as they
learn their languages, use them, repair them, and extend them to use in new situations and for
new purposes. The investigation of language change can tell us much about why languages
are as they are, with all of their seeming irregularities. It can also provide us with a view of the
human mind at work, recognizing patterns, and extending them to new situations and uses.

12.1 **Language Change**

```
Earlier chapters have shown that languages are tightly patterned, in ways speakers rarely
imagine. Because languages seem to operate so smoothly, we might assume they are inert;
nothing could be further from the truth. All living languages
are dynamic, constantly being reshaped by their speakers.
Most of these adjustments are so gradual that they go unnoticed.
Yet when we look carefully at the kinds of changes that occur in
language, we can catch glimpses of the human mind at its most
creative.
Apart from occasional new technical terms or slang expres-
sions, we are rarely aware of language change. Can you identify
the language below? Can you understand it?
```
```
Sigemunde gesprong æfter dƝaðdæge dǀm unlytel ,
syððan wƯges heard wyrm Ɨcwealde, hordes hyrde.
```
```
It is English, but English at an earlier stage of development. This Old English passage is from
Beowulf , a manuscript written well over a thousand years ago.
```
**(1)** _Beowulf_ 884–887

```
sigemunde gesprong æfter d ē aðdæge d ō m unlytel
to.Sigmund has arisen after death.day glory great
‘To Sigmund sprang forth great glory after his death,
syððan w ɩ̄ ges heard wyrm ā cwealde hordes hyrde
Since of.fight brave serpent killed.off of.treasure guardian
because in brave warfare, he killed the dragon, guardian of the treasure.’
Examine the passage carefully and look for any similarities between the language used and
modern English. Some of the words are immediately familiar: æfter ‘after,’ d ē að ‘death,’ and
dæg ‘day.’ Some become identifiable after some consideration. Unlytel is ‘un-little’ or ‘not
small’; heard is the ancestor of modern hardy, hord of modern hoard , and hyrde of modern
herd , as in shepherd. But there are certainly differences between the English of then and now.
These differences fall under several types:
```
```
tPhonological: The noun dæg ‘day’ has a g at the end. The vowel in heard is not the same as
that of modern hardy.
```
### SIDEBAR 12.1

```

**287 12 Language Change**

```
tMorphological: The verb ge-sprong has a prefix ge -, an old marker of past participles (adjectival
forms of verbs). Many of the nouns have case suffixes, which identify their roles in the sentence.
The nouns w ɩ̄ g ‘fight’ and hord ‘treasure,’ for example, end in - es , the genitive marker meaning
‘of.’ The name Sigemund-e ends in the dative marker - e meaning ‘to.’ The compound d ē aðdæg-e
‘death day’ also ends in the dative - e , which identifies it as the object of the preposition ‘after.’
tSyntactic: The verb ‘sprang’ occurs in second position in the first clause, before its subject ‘great
glory.’ This word order is occasionally found in stylized constructions today, but it is rare in every-
day conversation. In the second clause, the object ‘dragon’ occurs before the verb ‘killed,’ which
is not a possible order today. Modern English word order is strongly SVO.
tLexical: Some of the vocabulary has been replaced by other words in modern English, such as
w ɩ̄ g ‘fight, warfare.’
tSemantic: The meanings of a number of the words have changed. D ō m ‘glory’ has developed
into modern doom; wyrm ‘serpent, dragon’ into modern worm; cweal-de ‘kill-ed’ into modern
quell-ed.
```
12.2 **Sounds**

```
Chapter 3 described ways that speakers alter their pronuncia-
tion of sounds. These alternations can result in allophones. Over
time, the same kinds of processes can result in significant sound
change.
```
```
12.2.1 Here and There: Sound Change
English spelling is notorious for being difficult to learn. It seems to fit the language badly.
There is a reason for this. Old English was written in a version of the Roman alphabet intro-
duced by Irish missionaries. Words were spelled according to their pronunciation at the time,
with letters representing their Latin values. As sounds changed over the course of the
development of English, spelling practices changed too, but not as quickly as pro-
nunciation. Words now spelled with final e , such as her(e) and
ther(e) , were once pronounced with a full final vowel. As time
went by, this unstressed e underwent lenition (weakening). By
Chaucer’s time in the late fourteenth century, it had become
reduced to schwa [ə]. Further lenition resulted in complete loss.
Sound changes can be described with rules much like those
used in phonology. The term synchrony is used to refer to
language structures at a single point in time. Synchronic rules,
such as those discussed in Chapter 3, are operative at a specific
moment, typically the present. The term diachrony is used to
refer to comparisons of two or more points in time. A diachronic
rule describes a change in the system between one time and another. We could describe the
lenition of the vowel e to schwa with a diachronic rule like the one below:
```
```
*e > ə (The vowel e became schwa.)
```
### SIDEBAR 12.2

```
To refresh your memory of
allophones , see Section 3.2.2.
```
### SIDEBAR 12.3

```
Lenition and other common
phonological processes are
summarized in Textbox 3.6.
Reviewing the material in this
textbox now will benefit your
understanding of sound change and
the material in this chapter. Also see
Textbox 12.2 (later in this chapter).
```

**288 Marianne Mithun**

```
The asterisk * marks a sound that we infer existed at an earlier time; we have not actually
heard it, but we hypothesize what it might have been, in this case on the basis of early doc-
uments. Where synchronic phonological rules contain an arrow ߛ, diachronic rules usually
have the symbol >, which can be read as ‘became.’ Textbox 12.1 discusses this and other
differences in rule-writing between historical linguistics and phonology.
```
### TEXTBOX 12.1 RULE-WRITING IN HISTORICAL LINGUISTICS AND PHONOLOGY

```
Note that rule-writing in historical linguistics is similar to
rule-writing in phonology. The primary differences are as
follows: the use of the symbol >, rather than ߛ, between
the input and the output of the rule; the frequent use of
```
```
rules with no contexts, indicating that the sound change
was unconditioned and thus took place everywhere; and
the representation of multiple phases of a sound change
in a single rule, e.g., *e > ə > Ø.
```
```
The lenition of e to schwa that we saw in here and there did not occur everywhere in
the language. It happened only at the ends of words: it was what is called a conditioned
sound change. We can specify the context in which it occurred (only at the ends of
words), in the same way as in a synchronic phonological rule. We add a slash / to announce
that the environment for the change is coming up. We use an underline (a blank) __ to
stand for the position of the sound in question. We then specify what sounds occur before
it to the left of the blank, and what sounds occur after it to the right. In this case, it does
not matter what occurred before the e , so nothing appears on the left. The crucial context
is what occurred after the e , namely a word boundary. This is indicated by the symbol #.
```
```
*e > ə /_# (The vowel e became schwa at the ends of words.)
```
```
The weakening or leniting of word-final e did not stop at schwa. It continued over time
until there was no vowel left at all. We can add this fact to our rule, with a zero:
```
```
*e > ə > Ø /_# (The vowel e became schwa and was then lost at the ends of words.)
```
```
There are numerous other examples of lenition that took place during the development
from Old English to Modern English. As we saw in (1), the noun ‘day’ was spelled dæg. The
final g was pronounced at the time, but it later underwent lenition to a velar fricative, then
was further weakened to just a glide.
```
### STOP AND REFLECT 12.1 ENGLISH SPELLING

```
Have you ever wondered why English words like night, light , and right are spelled with gh? Those words once
contained velar fricatives [x], which were first lenited (weakened) to [h], and then ultimately lost.
```
### STOP AND REFLECT 12.2 ENGLISH SPELLING

```
A number of English words begin with the letters kn , such as knee, knight, knit, knead, knave, knife, knock,
knot, know , and knuckle. What could explain these spellings? Could you summarize the reason with a
diachronic rule? Think about it and compare your answer with that found in Sidebar 12.4.

12.2.2 Trees and Leaves: Change in the System
Sound change can have more profound effects; it can result in the remodeling of the
sound system. The most common way to form a plural in present-day English is to add
the suffix -s to the basic form of the noun: tree/tree-s, flower/flower-s. But not all words follow
this pattern. Consider the plurals of leaf, wife , and shelf: leaf/leave-s, wife/wive-s , and shelf/
shelve-s. The noun roots change shape: /li:f ~ li:v-/, /waif ~ waiv-/, /ܭݕlf ~ ܭݕlv-/.
```
### SIDEBAR 12.4

```
Answer to Stop and Reflect 12.2:
The spelling of English words such as
knee, knight , and knit reflects an earlier
pronunciation of these words. They originally
began with the consonant cluster /kn/.
Over time, the /k/ was lost and the initial
cluster was simplified to /n/. This /k/ is still
pronounced in other Germanic languages, for
example German Knie /kni:/, ‘knee.’
A diachronic rule for this could be
expressed:
*k > Ø /#_n
```
### STOP AND REFLECT 12.3 IRREGULARITIES

```
In English we have singular/plural pairs knife/knives , and self/selves. Can you imagine why we have chef/chefs
and not chef/cheves? Compare your answer with that found in Sidebar 12.6.
```
```
As seen in Chapter 3, phonemes may have alternate pro-
nunciations, called allophones. A common process that
produces allophones is assimilation , whereby a sound
comes to be more like its neighbors. Old English origi-
nally had just one series of fricative phonemes: /f/, /ș/,
/s/, /ݕ/, and /x/. Each of these fricatives had allophones.
When a fricative occurred between voiced sounds, it was
automatically voiced too. We could write a synchronic
phonological rule to describe the allophony at that time.
Fricatives assimilated to their neighbors in voicing.
```
```
[fricative] ĺ [+voice] / [+voice] __ [+voice]
```
```
The voicing was predictable: the fricative [v], for exam-
ple, occurred only inside of words, between voiced
sounds, while [f] occurred everywhere else, that is, at the
beginnings of words, at the ends, or next to a voiceless
sound. This is a familiar pattern of complementary
distribution.
With the Norman invasion in 1066, French speakers
began to arrive in England in significant numbers. As time went by, the influence of their
language on English became increasingly apparent. Many French words were adopted into
English. The adverb very , for example, came into English from the Old French verrai (mod-
ern French vrai ‘true’). The ancestors of the present-day English words veal, veil, venerable,
vengeance, venison, venom, vent, vermin, vessel, villain, vine, voyage , and many more were
borrowed from French. The influx of so many words beginning with v upset the old pattern
of complementary distribution. The result was minimal pairs such as fine and vine. Voicing
was no longer predictable. This led to a change in the phonological system: the addition
of a new phoneme /v/. Sounds that were originally allophones became separate phonemes.

12.2.3 The Moon and the Goose: The Great Vowel Shift

```
Have you ever wondered why the letter o is pronounced [o] in words like so , but [u] when
it is doubled, as in moon and goose? Vowels are some of the most puzzling aspects of the
English spelling system.
As mentioned earlier, when the Roman alphabet was
adopted for the spelling of Old English, the vowel letters
were used to represent approximately the same sounds
as in Latin. Like Latin, Old English had both long and
short vowels: long vowels – as in moon and keep – simply
lasted longer than short ones. At a certain point, English
speakers began to shorten long vowels in certain con-
texts, a conditioned sound change. One of these con-
texts was before consonant clusters, as in monthly and
kept. Then, beginning around 1400, vowel sounds began
to shift. Long vowels began to rise. Long low vowels (ā,
ɔ̄) were pronounced as mid (ǣ, ō). (English vowel length
is traditionally written with a macron, or a bar, over the
vowel.) Mid vowels (ē, ō) were pronounced as high (ɩ̄, ū). The highest long vowels (ɩ̄, ū),
which could not rise any higher, broke into diphthongs (ԥi, ԥu). These changes, which took
place gradually over a period of three centuries, are referred to collectively as the Great
Vowel Shift. Stages in the process can be seen in Table 12.1.
Because of these shifts, the pronunciation of vowels in Modern English is now very different
from that in Old English, when the spelling system originated. This history explains some of
the puzzles of modern spelling. The words moon and goose are spelled with oo because they were
once pronounced with long o. The words beet and beat are spelled differently because they were
once pronounced differently: there was a merger. The two vowels ɩ̄ and ē merged by the time
of Wordsworth to ɩ̄. The result was a change in the system, from seven long vowels (including
diphthongs) to six, and a reduction in the number of long vowels that were not diphthongs.
```
### SIDEBAR 12.6

```
Answer to Stop and Reflect 12.3:
The plural of chef ( chefs ) is not formed
in the same way as those of knife and self
( knives, selves ) for a reason. Knife and self are
Germanic in origin. This means that they were
already part of English when speakers started
automatically voicing fricatives between voiced
sounds ( knives, selves ). The voicing pattern
began to fade after the Norman Conquest. By
the time chef came into English, the automatic
voicing was long gone.

```
The Great Vowel Shift also explains what might seem like
senseless allomorphy, such as that of the noun roots in moon/
mon-thly and goose/gos-ling. The vowels in moon and goose were
long, as we can still see from their spelling. During the Great
Vowel Shift, they rose from [o:] to [u:]. The vowels in month and
gosling , on the other hand, had been shortened, because they
occurred before consonant clusters. They were in closed sylla-
bles. They did not participate in the shift.
Changes in sounds and sound systems are constantly occur-
ring in languages all over the world. We cannot predict exactly
which changes will occur at a particular time, but we do know
about the kinds of changes that tend to occur under particu-
lar circumstances. Some of the more common types of sound
change are listed in Textbox 12.2.
```
### SIDEBAR 12.7

```
In Table 12.1, the columns for
Chaucer and Shakespeare show
both the spelling (on the left) and
the pronunciation of the first vowel
(on the right). English orthography
changed between Chaucer and
Shakespeare, but it has changed
little since then, even though
pronunciation has continued to shift.
```
### TEXTBOX 12.2 SOME COMMON SOUND CHANGES

```
Certain types of sound changes occur more often than
others, usually because they result in less effort for
speakers. Some of the more common types are below.
```
**1. Lenition**
    Speakers often try to put as little energy into
    pronunciation as possible. Some common kinds
    of lenition, or weakening, are shifts of voiceless
    stops to voiced ones (p > b, t > d, k > g), stops to
    fricatives (p > f, t > s, k > x), oral fricatives to h (f >
    h, s > h, š > h, x > h), voiced obstruents to glides (b
    > w, v > w, g > j, dݤ > j), and shifts of vowels toward
    the center (i > ə, e > ə, a > a). We saw an example
    of lenition in the shift of Old English _dæg_ to Modern
    English _day_.
**2. Loss**
    Extreme weakening ultimately results in complete
    loss of a sound. We saw loss of the velar stop [k]
    from English words like _knee_ and _knife_ , and loss
    of the velar fricative [x] from English words like
    _night_ and _right_. The lenition and loss of final [e] is
    rampant, as in _here_ and _there_.
**3. Consonant Addition: Excrescence**
    Consonants are sometimes added sporadically.
    Proto-Indo-European * _swesr-_ developed into Proto-
    Germanic * _swestr_ , with an added _t_ , the ancestor
    of Modern English _sister_. Old English _þunrian_

```
changed into þundrian , ‘thunder,’ with an added
d. (Compare German Donner .) Such excrescent
consonants usually result from tiny shifts in
the timing of articulatory movements. Moving
from the nasal stop n to the oral continuant r of
þunrian , speakers closed off the nasal passage
before opening up the mouth, resulting in the oral
stop d.
```
**4. Vowel Addition: Prothesis and Epenthesis**
    Vowels are sometimes inserted to break up
    consonant clusters. Addition at the beginning of a
    word is termed **prothesis**. A well-known example is
    the shift of Latin _spiritus_ to Spanish _espiritu_ ‘spirit.’
    Addition within a word is termed **epenthesis** , as in
    the pronunciation of English _athlete_ as _athalete_.
**5. Fusion**
    Two sounds sometimes merge into one. We saw
    an example of vowel fusion in the shift from Old
    English _d_ ē _að_ to modern _death_ , now pronounced
    [dɛș].
**6. Breaking**
    One vowel sound may separate into two. We saw
    breaking in the long high vowels affected by the
    Great Vowel Shift. An example is the vowel of
    English _foul_ , pronounced [u:] in Chaucer’s time but
    [au] today.

12.3 **Grammar**

```
It might be tempting to think that since all languages have grammar, often with fairly rigid
rules, the grammar we see now has been there from the beginning. But like sounds, gram-
mar is constantly evolving.
```
12.3.1 Grammaticalization Processes

```
Grammatical meanings are typically expressed in languages with small words (e.g.,
articles, prepositions, auxiliaries, etc.), clitics (e.g., English genitive = ’ s , future = ’ ll , and
negative = n ’ t ), and affixes (prefixes, suffixes, infixes, circumfixes). Some examples of
affixes discussed elsewhere in this volume are given in (2).
```
**(2)** Some grammatical affixes

```
Manange a - k ʰʌ^22 ‘not come’ a- NEG prefix ‘not’
Goemai mòe-jàpnúún ‘siblings’ mòe- PL prefix ‘-s’
Karo o-ya’wan ‘I left’ o- 1 SG prefix ‘I’
Seneca sa - :ayö’ ‘he came back’ sa - REP prefix ‘again’
Chontal sago-duy ‘eating’ -day DUR suffix ‘-ing’
Ilocano gilin-an ‘grinder’ -an NMLZ suffix ‘-er’
The grammatical morphemes that arise in languages are not random. They
grow out of what speakers choose to say most often on an everyday basis. Most
grammatical morphemes begin life as full words, usually with relatively general meanings.
In some cases, these origins can still be detected. For example, according to the Oxford
English Dictionary , the English grammatical morphemes beside and besides developed from
Old English phrases be si:dan and be sides ‘by the side.’ The word be is the ancestor of our
modern preposition by. The word si:dan is the Old English noun side , with the dative case
ending (required by the preposition be ). The word sides is the same noun with the genitive
```
**7. Assimilation**
    Sounds often become more like those around them.
    The final consonant in English _leaf_ , for example,
    became voiced when it was surrounded on both
    sides by other voiced sounds, as in _leaves_. This was
    assimilation in just one feature, voicing. The negative
    prefix _in-_ , as in _in-edible_ or _in-tangible_ , takes on
    the point of articulation of a following consonant:
    _im-possible_ [im-p], _in-complete_ [iƾ-k]. It shows
    complete assimilation before a liquid: _il-legal, ir-regular._
**8. Palatalization**
    A very common kind of assimilation is palatalization.
    Here a consonant takes on the point of articulation

```
of a following front vowel or glide, becoming
palatal. When a stop is palatalized, it often becomes
an affricate. Between the time of Proto-West
Germanic and that of Old English, *k shifted to the
affricate þ before front vowels i, e , and the glide
j. We can hear this in English church (Old English
cirice ). Its German cognate Kirke still retains the
original velar stops k.
Numerous other kinds of sound shifts occur as
well, some of them gradual and regular, such as
the vowel raising of the Great Vowel Shift, and
others sudden and sporadic, such as the occasional
pronunciation of the word irrelevant as irrevelant , a
kind of change known as metathesis.

case. Both originally had only a spatial meaning: ‘by the side of, near.’ The first can still be
used that way: beside the tree. The second is now used only with more abstract meaning: ‘in
addition, moreover.’ The development of lexical forms to grammatical forms (e.g., preposi-
tional phrases to prepositions and adverbs), and from grammatical to even more grammat-
ical forms (e.g., the abstract adverb besides ) is termed grammaticalization.
Grammaticalization does not affect single words in isolation. It normally applies to words
in particular constructions. As speakers use a certain sequence of words with increasing
frequency, it can become automated and processed as a unit. It
is a bit like driving to a friend’s house in an unfamiliar area. The
first time you go, you might think consciously about each stage
of the journey: turning off the highway here, continuing for one
mile, veering left, passing the fire station, etc. After several visits,
you no longer focus on the individual steps; you simply drive
to visit your friend. A similar cognitive process occurs with fre-
quent phrases or constructions. Rather than focusing on each
word, speakers simply select the whole construction as a chunk. Grammar is the product of
the cognitive routinization of frequently recurring patterns of expression.
Constructions undergoing grammaticalization are typically extended to more and more
contexts. As a result, their meanings tend to become more general and more abstract. We
saw an example of such abstraction in the shift of the meaning of besides from physical
location to ‘moreover.’ (See Textbox 12.3 for another such example.) In most languages,
full lexical items such as nouns and verbs occur with certain inflectional morphemes, such
as tense or plural markers. These markers typically disappear during grammaticalization, a
process termed decategorialization. We can see this in the development of English aux-
iliaries, which no longer carry person agreement. We can say She sing-s , but not She can-s
sing. Finally, words undergoing grammaticalization within a particular construction tend to
lose their individual salience, typically losing their stress and ultimately showing further
phonological erosion. This, too, we can see in the case of English auxiliaries, such as the
erosion of will to ’ ll , as in I’ll.
```

development of grammatical forms,

Textbox LP4.2, on the development
of cases in Finnish.
```
### TEXTBOX 12.3 GRAMMATICALIZATION PATHWAYS

```
Certain types of grammatical developments occur
again and again in the world’s languages. One
common grammaticalization pathway is the
development of body-part nouns into adpositions.
The origins of prepositions in Dhaasanac (a Cushitic
```
```
language of Ethiopia and Kenya), for example, are
still clear: ʔ afu ‘in front of’ comes from the noun for
‘mouth,’ bál ‘beside’ from ‘chest,’ sugu ‘behind’ from
‘back,’ géere ‘inside’ from ‘belly’ (Tosco 2001, cited in
Heine 2011).
```
```
Prefixes and suffixes usually develop through similar processes. We can still perceive the
origins of some. The English suffix -ful in playful, masterful , and useful creates adjectives. In
measure terms like spoonful, cupful , and armful , it creates nouns. The source of the suffix is
still obvious: it developed from the adjective full , which survives in present-day English.
```

**294 Marianne Mithun**

```
When a word undergoes grammaticalization, the original form may continue in the lan-
guage with its function. Both the adjective full and the suffix - ful already existed in Old
English. The two have survived alongside each other for over a thousand years.
We can observe processes of grammaticalization occurring in English as we speak. One
of the most discussed examples is /aimna/ (see, e.g., Hopper and Traugott 2004: 2–4). Do
you recognize it? Try pronouncing it with a verb: /aimnə it/. This is I am going to, as in I am
going to eat. This construction apparently developed out of constructions like I am going to
see my father. The original meaning involved a change in physical location for a purpose. A
locative adverb could be included: I am going [to town] to see my father. The intended action
would occur in the future, following the change in location indicated by the motion verb
go. The current meaning of the construction is simply future tense. This shift in meaning
from purpose to futurity is a kind of metonymic process, or a
change resulting from the frequent association of two elements
in the same speech situation. If someone acts in order to bring
about some event ( I am going [ in order ] to see my father ), that
event will normally take place in the future (seeing my father).
The original construction thus involves both purpose and futurity. Over time, the futurity
is reinterpreted as the primary meaning.
Grammaticalization can also have a syntactic side. At a certain point, speakers apparently
reinterpreted the syntactic structure of the construction be going to from a main clause I am
going plus a purposive subordinate clause to see my father ( I am going [ to see my father ]), to a
sentence with a future auxiliary phrase be going to: I am going to [ see my father ]. This process
is called syntactic reanalysis. Speakers came to conceive of the syntactic structure in a
new way. Such a shift is not immediately obvious. It becomes apparent only when these
speakers create new sentences that are incompatible with the old analysis. When one says
I am going to like it , it is unlikely that motion is intended. The fact that syntactic reanalysis
has occurred is confirmed by sentences with a second verb go , like I am going to [ go to town ].
The be going to future construction also shows phonological effects that are typical of
developing grammatical constructions: the words are losing their individual stress and
undergoing further phonological erosion. We now hear I’m going to eat, I’m gonna eat, Imna
eat , and even sometimes Ima eat. Note that such reduction does not occur with the original
more concrete construction. No one would reduce I’m going to town to I’m gonna town.
Grammaticalization can involve metaphorical extension , or the use of an existing
word or construction from one domain to express a concept in another. A frequent meta-
phorical change involves the extension of markers denoting spatial relations to use for the
realm of time. An example can be seen in Cherokee, an Iroquoian language now spoken
primarily in North Carolina and Oklahoma. Cherokee contains an ancient verb prefix ta -
meaning ‘hither, toward the speaker.’
```
**(3)** Cherokee cislocative ‘hither’ (Montgomery-Anderson 2008: 328, 354)

```
ta-kinatansiinooheéli ‘He’s crawling toward us’
ta-àkiiluhcheéli ‘He came up to us’
This prefix has now been extended to indicate future tense as well.
```
### SIDEBAR 12.10

and metaphors , see Section 7.11.

```
(4) Cherokee future (Montgomery-Anderson 2008: 330–331)
ta-yuùhali ‘He will look for it’
ta-kintlecheéli ‘He will take revenge on us’
This development suggests a view of the future as something that is coming toward us.
As we look at the kinds of distinctions encoded in grammatical markers in languages
around the world, we find that some meanings occur in language after language, such as
negation, tense, plurality, and causation. The frequency of such grammatical morphemes
points to certain universal human concerns, and to concepts that people tend to express
often. At the same time, we sometimes find surprising grammatical markers, with very spe-
cific meanings. The suffixes in (5) are from Nuuchahnulth.
```
```
(5) Nuuchahnulth suffixes (Stonham 2005)
-’ ahs ‘in a vessel or container’
tuw’-ahs- iƛ ‘jumped into the canoe’
tuw ’- ‘jump’

ƛ ii- ʕ a č i- ʔ iš ‘he was shooting in the bay’
ƛ ii - ‘shoot’
-at ‘out of the woods’
wika-at’-as ‘she did not come out of the woods’
wika- ‘come’
-a č n’ut ‘from snout to dorsal fin’
hitwee ʔ in su č ’iit-a č n’ut ‘it was five fathoms from snout to dorsal fin’
su č ’-iit- ‘five-fathom’
Nuuchahnulth is a language of the Wakashan family, spo-
ken on Vancouver Island, off the coast of British Columbia.
The ocean has been a central part of the lives of Nuuchahnulth
people for a long time. Examples like these show that the gen-
eral processes by which grammatical morphemes and patterns
develop are very similar across languages, but the specific dis-
tinctions they encode are shaped by the concerns of individual speech communities.
```
```
12.3.2 Renewal: Restoring Expressive Power
The kinds of processes seen in the previous section are constantly at work in all languages.
But if this is the case, shouldn’t all languages have eroded to nothing or nearly nothing by
now? In fact, there are other processes of change that help to maintain a certain equilibrium.
As frequently used expressions become routine, they can lose their expressive punch:
their impact can fade. But a primary function of language is communication: speakers use
language to convey their thoughts, often in creative ways. This creativity can restore fresh-
ness and power to the language. An illustration of such a cycle is the development of nega-
tive constructions in English. In Old English, negation was usually indicated with a negative
particle ne , as in the sentence ic ne wa:t ‘I don’t know.’ (The verb wa:t ‘know’ has since fallen

**296 Marianne Mithun**

```
out of English.) Negation is expressed frequently in all languages, so negative constructions
are likely candidates for routinization and erosion over time. Old English ne was already
a small word. But negation is crucial information. To highlight its importance, speakers
often reinforced negative sentences with extra words, such as wiht ‘something, anything’ or
na: wiht ‘nothing, not anything.’ After a while ne was no longer used on its own; na: wiht
became the regular negative marker. With regular use, its emphatic force began to diminish
as well. Its phonological form has now eroded to modern not and even n’t.
```
**(6)** English negation (Hock and Joseph 1996: 176)

```
Stage I ic ne wa:t ‘I don’t know’ (Old English) basic
ic ne wa:t (na:)wiht ‘I don’t know (no) thing’ emphatic
Stage II ic ne wa:t ‘I don’t know’ basic
ic ne wa:t (na:)wiht ‘I don’t know at all’ emphatic
Stage III ic ne wa:t na:wiht ‘I don’t know’ basic
Stage IV I wot(e) not ‘I don’t know’ (Shakespeare) basic
The cycle of renewal continues today. Modern speakers often reinforce what is now the
ordinary negative not with phrases like at all or a bit.
```
12.3.3 Analogy: Repairing Patterns

```
The human capacity for pattern recognition is crucial for learning and using a language.
Not only do humans search for patterns as they learn their mother tongue, and use
them as models for creating new utterances; they often go further to repair what
they perceive to be irregularities. Language can change both when children make novel
hypotheses about the patterns behind the speech they hear, and when speakers attempt to
regularize existing patterns.
We saw earlier that sound change can create irregularities in morphology. The most com-
mon way to form plurals in English is simply to add a plural suffix to the basic form of the
noun: tree/trees. But because of various events in the history of English, some nouns change
their form in the plural, as in leaf/leaves /li:f~li:v-/.
```
### STOP AND REFLECT 12.4 HAVE YOU REPAIRED IRREGULAR FORMS?

```
Try saying the pair house/houses and listen to your pronunciation. For many English speakers, the noun house
shows the same kind of allomorphy as leaf/leaves : it is /haus~hauz-/. The cause is the same. But for other
speakers, in many cases younger ones, the irregularity has been repaired: they use the same form of the noun
root in the singular and the plural: [haus~haus-]. Which pronunciation do you use?
```
```
Repairs like the regularization of the plural of house are termed analogical remode-
ling. Speakers perceive a strong pattern among certain pairs of words ( tree/trees, flower/
flowers, bird/birds, cloud/clouds ) and, by analogy to those pairs, remodel exceptions to make
them fit the pattern.
Whether the remodeling occurs when children are first acquiring their language or later
in life, once it has occurred, the result simply becomes part of the language. Have you ever
```

**297 12 Language Change**

```
thought about the past tense of the verb dive? The original form is dived , but for many
speakers, it is now dove. This might at first seem surprising: the most common past-tense
marker in English is - ed. But English also contains robust sets of
what are called strong verbs. These verbs form their past tenses
with a vowel change, a pattern called ablaut. One such pattern
can be seen in drive/drove and ride/rode. The past tense of dive was
apparently remodeled by analogy to such verbs.
In this section we have seen only a sample of the ways lan-
guages can evolve. Many more occur, some quite commonly,
others more rarely. Most examples here have been taken from English, but all of these pro-
cesses occur in languages around the world.

Words in different languages may resemble each other for several reasons. One is ono-
matopoeia , or imitation of sounds. Names of birds, for example, are sometimes coined
from imitations of their calls, like whippoorwill or chickadee. Speakers of different languages
might come up with similar imitations. This is an unlikely explanation for similarities
among numerals. A second possibility is chance: only a certain number of sounds can
be made with the human mouth, and it is not impossible that the same combination of
sounds could have similar meanings in different languages
by chance. There is a verb č húw in Central Pomo, a lan-
guage indigenous to Northern California, which means
‘eat.’ It has no relation to English chew , however. A third is
language contact : often speakers adopt words from one
language into another. This is the source of much English
vocabulary, such as spaghetti (Italian), champagne (French), and even tea (Chinese). But
words for the lowest numerals are rarely borrowed. The fourth and perhaps most common
reason for lexical similarities across languages is that the languages are descended from the
same parent language. The similar words are a common inheritance from their ancestor,
that is, cognates.
Languages are always changing. The change typically begins with variation, from
speaker to speaker and situation to situation. As long as speakers are communicating with
each other, they will not change their speech so radically as to interrupt intelligibility. When
a community splits, however, and the splinter groups no longer interact, their speech will no
longer change in parallel. The longer they are separated, the
greater the differences will become. Dialects will develop:
people may still understand each other but notice differ-
ences, as in the case of British and American English. In
time, speakers in the different communities will no longer
understand each other, as in the case of English and German. At that point, they are said to
speak different languages. All languages that are descended from a common parent are said
to belong to the same language family. The languages within a family are often called
daughter languages. They are said to be genetically ( genealogically) related.
The languages represented in Example (7) are the following: (a) French, (b) Spanish,
(c) Italian, (d) Portuguese, (e) Romanian, (f) German, (g) Dutch, (h) Yiddish, (i) Swedish,

their numerals look quite different. Hungarian and Finnish (p, q) are from the Finno-Ugric

Mohawk and Seneca (y, z) are Iroquoian. Turkish (r), Japanese (w), and Swahili (x) have no

Among the Indo-European languages, numerals in some languages resemble each other
especially closely, such as those in French, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, and Romanian (a, b,
c, d, e); those in German, Dutch, and Yiddish (f, g, h); those in Swedish and Danish (i, j); and
those in Polish, Russian, Czech, and Macedonian (k, l, m, n). As far as is known, the origi-
nal Indo-European speech community separated into over a dozen groups: Romance (a–e),
Germanic (f–j), Slavic (k–n), etc. Many of these groups then divided again. The Germanic
group split into a North Germanic subgroup (the modern Scandinavian languages), a West
Germanic subgroup (English, Dutch, Frisian, German, Yiddish), and an East Germanic sub-
group (Gothic). In general, languages that have split the most recently show the most sim-
ilarities: they have shared a longer history of common development.

of it, all that is known is what can be reconstructed by comparing the daughter languages.
(See Textbox 12.5 for more on methods used to determine subgroupings.) A reconstructed
ancestral language is termed a proto-language. The reconstructed ancestor of English and
its relatives is called Proto-Indo-European.

```
12.5 **The Comparative Method**

```
To determine that languages are related, we begin by looking for resemblances among basic
words, like the numerals in (7) above. But random similarities do not, on their own, con-
stitute evidence of genealogical relationship. The similarities could be due to any of the
four factors mentioned above: onomatopoeia, chance, contact, or common inheritance. To
uncover genealogical relationships, we look for recurring sound correspondences. This
is done by applying the comparative method. The method will be illustrated here with
three languages indigenous to northern California: Wintu, Nomlaki, and Patwin.
```
### TEXTBOX 12.5 CLADISTICS

```
Computational methods are also being explored for
answering questions about subgroupings, that is,
interrelationships among languages already known
to have developed from a common ancestor. One
method, which comes from work in evolutionary
biology, is cladistics. Similarities among languages
are calculated in terms of the numbers of features (or
“characters”) they share, such as lexical cognates,
sound changes, and inflectional morphology. A
group of languages that share a significant number
of features is called a “clade.” A clade can be likened
to a subgroup in a traditional family tree. But while
family trees show a common parent language at
the top, with successive splits into subgroups and
```
```
ultimately individual languages at the bottom, as
in Figure 12.1, cladistics first produces networks,
or “unrooted trees.” Cladograms simply arrange

that the line representing the Avestan-Vedic branch is
longer than that for the Albanian-Old English branch.

12.5.1 Step I: Identifying Similar Morphemes
The first step is to identify potential cognates , or morphemes that are similar enough in
form and meaning to be descended from the same morpheme in a common parent language.
Compare the words in (8) to see whether any might not belong. Wintu lad (k), a kind of
hawk, is completely different in form from Nomlaki č eq č eq and Patwin tektek. We will not
consider it further in our comparison.
Potential cognates must also be similar enough in meaning to have developed from the
same word in the parent language. Full semantic details of the words could not be included in
(8) for reasons of space; however, some of the words in (8) have exactly the same meanings,
such as ma:t/ma:t/ma:t ‘ear’ (a), while others differ. Differences do not mean they cannot be
related: meanings can change over time. But the differences must represent plausible seman-
tic change. Nomlaki yuken and Patwin yu č en in (n) are translated ‘enemy.’ Wintu yuken is
translated ‘dangerous, at war, Shasta.’ The Shasta people were the northern neighbors of the
Wintu. The semantic relationship between ‘enemy’ and ‘dangerous/Shasta’ is sufficient for
us to consider them possible cognates. On the other hand, Nomlaki has a word leni ‘grass,’
and Patwin a word le:ni ‘yesterday.’ This difference is too great for them to be cognates.
Finally, it is crucial that specific morphemes be compared. The ‘frog’ words in (c) are
Wintu wataqmet , Nomlaki wataq , and Patwin wata:k. The element -met in Wintu is an
‘amphibian reptile suffix’ (Pitkin 1985: 348). It also appears in Wintu yir-met ‘mountain
```

**302 Marianne Mithun**

```
lizard’ and yoho:l-met ‘(another kind of) frog.’ We only need to compare the roots wataq/
wataq/wata:k. In the forms in (p) for ‘climb,’ dek-ma, dek-na , and det-mu , only the roots dek
are comparable. We do not need to consider the suffixes in our comparison.
Most of this first step has already been done for you in (8). Potential cognates have been
assembled, and morphemes have been separated with hyphens.
```
12.5.2 Step II: Listing Correspondences

```
When we compare the words ma:t/ma:t/ma:t ear’ in (a), we see that where Wintu has m ,
Nomlaki and Patwin also have m. We can summarize this in what is called a correspond-
ence set : m/m/m. In the same word we see a:/a:/a: and t/t/t. In qacit/qacit/katit ‘hawk’ (i),
we find the sets q/q/k, a/a/a, č / č /t, i/i/i , and t/t/t. These sets recur in the data, and with more
data, we would see even more. Take a moment now to list all the consonant correspondence
sets you find in the data in (8). List each set once, arranging any that share sounds, or are
phonetically similar, near each other.
In the words ‘tumpline’ (t) and ‘belt’ (u), Nomlaki shows nothing where Wintu and
Patwin both show r. We write this correspondence using a zero: r/Ø/r. Nomlaki words for
‘woodpecker’ (q) and ‘ash’ (s) are not available. We represent this gap in the data with a
hyphen when first setting up the sets. For the first sound in ‘woodpecker,’ we write t/-/t.
Since we have only one other set where this pattern would appear to fit, in this case t/t/t , we
can assume that t/-/t exemplifies this pattern. (However, if we had two other correspond-
ence sets where the pattern could fit, such as t/t/t and t/d/t , then we could not make such
an assumption.)
p/p/p s/s/s y/y/y m/m/m l/l/l q/q/k
b/b/b h/h/h w/w/w n/n/n ł/ł/ł k/k/ čč / č /t
d/d/d r/Ø/r k/k/t t/t/t
```
12.5.3 Step III: First Pass at Reconstruction

```
We now propose sounds in the parent language, Proto-Wintun, that could be the ancestors
of each correspondence set. Each reconstructed sound should be such that:
```
```
a. The changes from it to each of its reflexes (descendant sounds) in the daughter language are
as plausible as possible, i.e., the kinds of natural changes we know that sounds undergo cross-
linguistically. Earlier in this chapter we saw some particularly common kinds of change, e.g.,
lenition and assimilation.
b. The changes are as few in number as possible.
```
```
The most likely ancestor of the set p/p/p , for example, is *p. This is a hypothesis that Proto-
Wintun contained a sound *p that remained unchanged during the several thousand years of
development into modern Wintu, Nomlaki, and Patwin. We follow the same procedure for
other uniform sets: *b for b/b/b , etc. Each has remained the same in the daughter languages.
```
```
Proto-Wintun
*p > p in W, N, P *m > m in W, N, P
*b > b in W, N, P *n > n in W, N, P
```

**303 12 Language Change**

```
*t > t in W, N, P *l > l in W, N, P
*d > d in W, N, P *ł > ł in W, N, P
*s > s in W, N, P *w > w in W, N, P
*h > h in W, N, P *y > y in W, N, P
The same procedure gives us easy reconstructions for the vowels, which are generally iden-
tical in the daughter languages. So far things look so simple that we hardly need to write
them out.
For the set r/Ø/r , a reconstruction of *r is most appropriate, but this entails a change. The
data here indicate that *r has disappeared in Nomlaki.
*r > r in Wintu, Patwin
Ø in Nomlaki
We next turn to q/q/k. Two possible reconstructions spring to mind: *q or *k. A choice of
*q entails just one change, *q > k in Patwin. It is a plausible change: shifts from uvular to
velar are common cross-linguistically.
*q > q in W, N
k in P
A choice of *k for the q/q/k set, however, would entail two changes, *k > q in Wintu and *k
> q in Nomlaki. Moreover, this change is much less common cross-linguistically. (It occurs
mainly by assimilation to low back vowels.)
```
```
12.5.4 Step IV: Combining Sets
We now turn to the sets k/k/ č and k/k/t. A separate proto-sound must be posited for each
correspondence set, unless there is evidence for combining the sets. A likely ancestral sound
for both k/k/ č and k/k/t would be *k. There may have been one original sound, *k, which
developed one way in some contexts and another way in others. *k may have developed
into Patwin č in some contexts, and t in others. To determine whether this happened, we
investigate the environments where each occurs. (This procedure is similar to that used for
finding allophones in complementary distribution.) We can list their contexts as follows.
The blank represents the correspondence set in each word. The sound that occurs before it
in each language is on the left, in the order Wintu/Nomlaki/Patwin. The sound that occurs
after it in each language is on the right.
k/k/č k/k/t
a/a/a__i/i/i e/e/e__m/n/m
#/#/# __ o/o/o a/-/a: __ #/#/#
#/#/# __ a/a/a e:/e:/e: __ #/#/#
u/u/u __ e/e/e i/-/i __ m/-/#
e/e/e __ e/e/e
We do have complementary distribution. The set k/k/ č always occurs before vowels. In con-
trast, the set k/k/t never occurs before vowels; it always occurs before a consonant or at the
end of the word. With this information, we can posit a single ancestral sound *k. This *k
remained k in Wintu and Nomlaki. It changed to č (the affricate [tݕ]) in Patwin. This is a
```

**304 Marianne Mithun**

```
plausible sound change, a simple fronting of the obstruent. Before another consonant or at
the end of a word, this č was simplified to the stop t. This too is a plausible change.
*k > k in Wintun, Nomlaki
č in Patwin
č > t /_C
_#
We are left with the set č / č /t. The most obvious reconstruction is *þ, a sound not used for
our Proto-Wintun consonant inventory so far. It implies just one change, *þ > t in Patwin,
and, as noted, it is a plausible change.
*č > č in Wintun, Nomlaki
t in Patwin
We should check to be certain that there is not complementary distribution between the con-
texts in which the č / č /t and the t/t/t correspondences occur. In fact there is not. Both occur, for
example, at the beginning of a word before a , as in (j) ‘good, straight’ (þ/þ/t) , and (q) ‘wood-
pecker’ (t/t/t). There is also no complementary distribution between the sets k/k/t and t/t/t. Both
occur after e at the end of a word, as in (r) ‘root’ ( k/k/t ) and (a) ‘ear’ ( t/t/t ). A check of the con-
texts for the sets l/l/l and ł/ł/ł also shows no complementary distribution. Both occur, for exam-
ple, at the beginning of words before a , as in (f) ‘wild goose’ ( l/l/l ) and (g) ‘play, gamble’ (ł/l/ł ).
```
12.5.5 Step V: Ordering Rules

```
Each of our rules represents a hypothesis about a sound change that took place in the lan-
guage. It is unlikely that they all occurred at once. So can we tell anything about the order
in which they did occur? Looking back at the last section, we see that we hypothesized the
two changes below for Patwin.
```
1. *q > k
2. *k > č
Our work indicates that the Proto-Wintun word for ‘hole’ was *holoq. If we assume that
the two rules we see there operated in that order (1 before 2), we would have the following
sequence of changes:
*holoq > *holok > holoč
*q > k *k > č
If, however, we hypothesize that they occurred in the opposite order (2 before 1), we would
have the following sequence of changes:
*holoq > holok
(*k > č) *q > k
Change 2 (*k > č) would not have affected the word ‘hole,’ because at that point the word
did not yet contain a _k_ (*holoq). The fact that the modern form is _holok_ and not _holo_ č
demonstrates that this second ordering, with *k > č occurring before *q > k, is correct.

12.5.6 Step VI: Inventory Check

```
We now consider the inventory of consonants that we have reconstructed for Proto-Wintun:
```

### TEXTBOX 12.6 INTERNAL RECONSTRUCTION

```
There are additional techniques for reconstructing
earlier stages of languages. Internal reconstruction
takes as a point of departure alternations within a single
language. For an example of how it works we can look
at Zuni, a language isolate indigenous to the North
American Southwest. We cannot apply the comparative
method to Zuni, because there are no data from related
languages to compare.
Zuni contains a verb prefix an - called an “applicative.”
The applicative indicates that an additional participant is
involved in the situation. Added to the verb ‘consent,’ it
creates a new verb that means ‘consent to (someone),’
that is, ‘permit someone to do something.’ Added to a
```
```
verb meaning ‘feel pleasure,’ it forms a new verb ‘feel
pleasure at (something), to enjoy (something).’
sewaha ‘to consent’ an-sewaha ‘to consent to’
ʔ eluma ‘to feel pleasure’ an- ʔ eluma ‘to enjoy’
But this prefix does not always appear as an -. Before
h it takes the shape ah -; before l , it is al -; before w it is
aw -; before the glide y [j] it is ay -.
heye ‘to defecate’ ah-heye ‘to defecate on’
lalhi ‘to jump’ al-laҌhi ‘to jump at’
we ʔ a ‘to burst out
laughing’
```
```
aw-weҌa ‘to burst out
laughing at’
yu þ ilati ‘to be
amazed’
```
```
ay-yuþiҌatika ‘to be amazed at’
```
```
*p *t *č *k
*b *d
*s *h
*m *n
*w *l *ł *r *y
This is a reasonable, balanced inventory. The absence of *g is noteworthy, but languages
with [b] and [d] but no [g] are actually not uncommon cross-linguistically.
```
```
12.5.7 Step VII: Reconstructing Words
We are now in a position to reconstruct full words. We will assume that the vowel inventory
consists of *i, *e, *a, *o, and *u, with no changes in the daughter languages. Some recon-
structions are straightforward:
Wintu Nomlaki Patwin Proto-Wintun
a. ‘ear’ ma:t ma:t ma:t *ma:t
Others require undoing the sound changes we posited:
b. ‘milkweed’ boq boq bok *boq
i. ‘hawk’ qačit qačit katit *qačit
t. ‘tumpline’ surut su:t surut *surut
Where the meanings of the cognates in the daughter languages are not identical, we must
choose a proto meaning. The words in (f) with their translations are Wintu laq ‘wild goose,’
Nomlaki laq ‘brant, green-wing teal,’ and Patwin laklak ‘goose species.’ The most likely
meaning of the Proto-Wintun term is ‘goose.’
Comparative reconstruction is one of the primary methods that linguists have used to
determine language relatedness and to reconstruct protolanguages. This method is comple-
mented by internal reconstruction , discussed in Textbox 12.6.

12.6 **Linguistic Paleontology**

```
Reconstruction of vocabulary in a proto-language can provide glimpses of the
world of its speakers. If, for example, we can reconstruct a term for ‘snow,’ we can
hypothesize that the speakers lived in an area with snow or within sight of snow. We have
this term for Proto-Indo-European, reconstructed as *sneigwh -. Watkins (1981) provides an
overview of Indo-European life as seen through reconstructed vocabulary.
The Indo-Europeans apparently lived in an area with wolves (* wlp -, * wlkwo -), bears (* rkso -),
beavers (* bhibhru -), and mice (* m ū s -). There were salmon or trout (* laks -), eels (* angwhi -),
cranes (* ger -), eagles (* er -), thrushes (* trozdos -), and starlings ( storos ). They knew wasps
(* wops ɑ̄), hornets (* krֱ ə s-ro -), flies (* mu -), and bees (* bhei -). They gathered honey (* melit -)
and made mead (* medhu -), a honey-based alcoholic beverage. Watkins hypothesizes that
the Indo-Europeans oriented themselves by facing east, because the root *deks - ‘right’ also
meant ‘south.’
Kinship terms reveal an interesting pattern. There are numerous terms for relatives by
marriage on the husband’s side, such as ‘husband’s father,’ ‘husband’s mother,’ ‘husband’s
brother,’ ‘husband’s sister,’ ‘husband’s brother’s wife,’ and ‘son’s wife,’ but none for the cor-
responding terms on the wife’s side. This fact suggests that couples took up residency with
the husband’s family.
The Indo-Europeans were farmers. They had words for ‘grain’ (* grano -, ancestor of our
corn), or wheat or spelt, and perhaps rye and barley. They ground it (* mel ə-, ancestor of
meal and mill ). They had verbs for ‘sow’ (* s ē-), ‘plow’ (* pl ō g -), ‘yoke’ (* yeug -), and ‘gather’
(* kerp -, ancestor of harvest ). They kept livestock, including cattle (* gwou - ‘cow/bull’), sheep
(* owi ), lambs (* agwhno -), goats (* ghaido -), and pigs (* porko -, ancestor of farrow ). They had
dogs (* kwon -), and this term was apparently the basis for their word for ‘horse’ (* ekwo -). The
root * peku - meant both ‘wealth’ and ‘cattle.’ They could weave (* webh -), sew (* sy ū-), and
produce textiles ( teks - ‘fabricate, weave’). They knew the wheel (* kwekwlo , based on the verb
root * kwel(H) - ‘turn’).
Indo-European vocabulary was rich in words for ideas, abstractions, and relations. There
were numerous terms for mental activity, among them * men - (source of English mind ).
There were also terms for ‘king’ (* reg -), a deity (* deiw -), religious law (* leg - and * yewo , ances-
tor of Latin jnjs ), and for preaching, praising, and prophesying or singing (* sengwh -).
```
```
The method of internal reconstruction looks beyond
such alternations to the scenario which is likely to have
created them. We know that one of the commonest
kinds of sound change is assimilation, whereby a sound
shifts to become more like its neighbor. The shifting
shapes of the Zuni prefix appear to be the result of such
changes. We hypothesize that the original applicative
```
```
prefix was simply *an-, the most common form.
Over time, regular processes of assimilation occurred,
resulting in the forms we have today: ah - before h, al -
before l, aw - before w , and ay - before y. We have thus
reconstructed a proto-form of the prefix, and several
sound changes, based only on data in this one modern
language.
```
```
TEXTBOX 12.6 ( cont. )
```

**307 12 Language Change**

```
As we reconstruct Proto-Indo-European vocabulary and draw inferences about the lives
of the Indo-Europeans, we cannot help but wonder just where these people lived. There
have been many hypotheses, but the puzzle is not yet solved. One approach is to com-
pare the reconstructed vocabulary with what we know about the natural environment and
archeological findings for that period, around the fourth millennium BCE, probably not
earlier than 5000 BCE and not later than 2500 BCE. The Indo-Europeans apparently lived
where there were wolves, bears, beavers, foxes, otters, hedgehogs, and mice; sparrows, quail,
thrushes, cranes, vultures, blackbirds, crows, ravens, eagles, jays, pheasants, and storks; and
turtles, frogs, and snakes. But unfortunately most of these animals and birds are ubiquitous
through Europe and adjacent Asia, so they do not help us to pinpoint a specific Indo-
European homeland.
The term for ‘birch’ is clearly reconstructible to * bherg’o -. As pointed out by Mallory
(1989: 161), it denotes the birch in Indic ( bhurja -), Iranian (Ossetic bärz ), Germanic ( birch ),
Baltic (Latvian berzs ), and Slavic (Russian berëza ). But the Latin cognate fraxinus means ‘ash,’
and there is no cognate in Greek. About half of the tree names reconstructed for Proto-Indo-
European show a shift in meaning in Greek. These facts are taken to suggest that the Indo-
Europeans originated elsewhere, then later moved into the area, applying original terms to
the new trees they encountered.
One possible location of the homeland is the grasslands area north of the Black and
Caspian Seas, known as the Pontic-Caspian steppes (Fortson 2004: 41). The reasoning
behind this proposal is interesting. We know that the Indo-Europeans had the wheel.
Archeological evidence suggests that wheeled vehicles were invented around 3300–3400
BCE. The Indo-European community could thus not have broken up before this time. At
this time, the steppes were inhabited by a group known as the Yamna, who came from the
area between the steppes and the nearby forest between the Dnieper and Volga rivers. We
know that the Indo-Europeans knew horses. The teeth of horses found in this area from
that time show microscopic abrasions, from clamping down on a bit. Additional aspects of
culture reconstructed through linguistic paleontology match archeological findings in the
area. But without a written tradition, it is not possible to identify the language of commu-
nities uncovered archeologically. This hypothesis, while promising, must remain just that.
```
### CHAPTER SUMMARY

```
We have seen that all aspects of language undergo change. At the phonological level,
certain types of sound change are particularly frequent, such as those involving lenition
or assimilation. Many of these are motivated by a desire on the part of speakers to reduce
the effort necessary for speech. Sound change can have effects beyond the shifting
of individual sounds: it can result in the restructuring of the phonological system,
with the addition and loss of distinctive features and phonemes. It can also produce
seeming irregularities, such as allomorphy. Grammar tends to develop via certain
pathways. Grammatical morphemes develop most often from independent lexical
items, a process termed grammaticalization. Grammaticalization typically involves a
```

**308 Marianne Mithun**

```
constellation of changes, including cognitive routinization, generalization of meaning,
decategorialization, and ultimately phonological erosion. But not all change is reductive.
Speakers are constantly reanalyzing the patterns underlying speech, repairing perceived
irregularities by analogical remodeling, and renewing constructions that have lost their
expressive force.
The fact that languages are constantly changing can result in the differentiation of
languages over time. A language family consists of all of those languages descended from
a common parent or proto-language. Relationships among these languages are often
represented by family tree diagrams. In this chapter we have seen an example of the
comparative method, used to establish genealogical relationships among languages and to
reconstruct aspects of their common parent, such as its sound system and vocabulary. The
reconstruction of vocabulary in the proto-language can in turn provide glimpses into the
lives of its speakers.
Languages are dynamic systems, constantly changing in all areas of their structure and
content. The changes are not predictable, but they are also not random. They are shaped
by certain human cognitive faculties such as pattern recognition, the routinization of
recurring patterns of expression, and the creative acts of speakers eager to find fresh and
powerful ways of conveying their thoughts.

in historical linguistics involves this step as well, the discovery of related forms. These exercises provide just
enough data for you to be able to detect certain patterns. Normally, one would consider much more data
for a solid analysis.

**1. French vowels: sound change**
    (Thanks to Ben Fortson for expertise on the Romance exercises.)
    Several of the exercises for this chapter present data from Romance languages. As we saw in Figure
    12.1, Romance is one of the branches of the Indo-European language family. Most of the modern
    languages in this branch are descended from Latin. Among these are French, Italian, Portuguese, and
    Spanish, as well as Romanian, Provençal, Catalan, Rhaeto-Romance dialects, and more.
    For this problem, look only at the stressed syllables. First describe in words what happened to the vowels in
    these syllables during the development of French. Then write a rule to capture your description.
       **Latin French
a.** ‘foot’ ́pĕde pied
**b.** ‘yesterday’ ́hĕrıˉ hier
**c.** ‘honey’ ́mĕl miel
**d.** ‘holds’ ́tĕnĕt tient
**e.** ‘stone’ ́pĕtra pierre
**f.** ‘hundred’ ́cĕntu cent
**g.** ‘wind’ ́vĕntu vent
**h.** ‘seven’ ́sĕpte(m) sept
**i.** ‘loses’ ́pĕrdiı ̆̆t perd
**j.** ‘iron’ ́fĕrru fer
**2.** Greenlandic consonants: sound change
    (Data from Fortescue, Jacobson, and Kaplan 1994) Languages of the Eskimo-Aleut family are spoken over a
    wide area of the Arctic, from Siberia to Greenland. The family consists of two main branches: Eskimoan and
    Aleut. The language of Greenland, called Kalaallisut, is a member of the first branch. The data here show
    one consonant sound shift. Write a rule to describe this sound change. (The symbol _y_ here is used for the
    IPA [j], while the symbol _c_ here represents the IPA [tݕ].)
    **Proto-Eskimoan Kalaallisut (Greenlandic)**
    **a.** *qayaq ‘kayak’ qayaq ‘kayak’
    **b.** *taciq ‘spit, sand bar’ tasiq ‘lake’
    **c.** *kicaq ‘anchor’ kisaq ‘anchor’
    **d**. *uciaR- ‘carry a load’ usiar- ‘carry load on one’s kayak’
    **e.** *kənit- ‘soak’ kinit- ‘soak in order to soften’
    **f.** *tucaR- ‘hear, understand’ tusaR- ‘hear’

**4. French sibilants: conditioned sound change**
    The earliest documentation we have of French is from the ninth century. The term Old French designates
    stages of the language from that time up to the fourteenth century. Of course, the language was
    undergoing change throughout that period.
       The French sibilants underwent systematic changes during the thirteenth century. (Look at the
    IPA transcriptions of Old French and Modern French, rather than their standard spellings. Each of the
    sequences tݕ, ts, ݶ, and dz represents a single consonant sound, an affricate.)
    **i.** Write rules to describe these changes. Describe in words the changes specified in each rule.
    **ii.** Describe in words any other changes that you notice here.
    **iii.** Can you understand why modern French spelling, in the right hand column, seems to fit modern
       French pronunciation so badly?

**5. Uto-Aztecan: comparative method**
    (Data from Sapir 1930; Lamb 1958; Miller 1972; Munro and Mace 1995; assembled in Miller 1988)
    The languages here are all from the Uto-Aztecan family. Shoshone territory stretches over areas of
    Nevada, Utah, Idaho, and Wyoming; Southern Paiute territory from southeastern California into Nevada,
    Arizona, and Utah; Mono territory on both sides of the Sierra Nevada Mountains in east central California;
    and Tubatulabal territory along the Kern River near modern Bakersfield, California.
    A number of developments have occurred since these languages diverged. Some of the words here include
    morphemes that are not cognate. These are set off by hyphens. You do not need to include those non-
    cognate morphemes in your analysis.
    For this problem, investigate only the velar stops and any related sounds. Reconstruct a proto-sound or
    sounds and write rules to describe developments in the various languages.

**6. Gum languages: comparative method**
    (Data from Z’graggen 1980) New Guinea is home to a vast number of languages, estimated at over 850.
    They show tremendous diversity as well. Many are not yet described or are under-described. The Gum
    languages are spoken in northeastern Papua New Guinea, in Madang Province. For this problem, you will
    reconstruct just some of the consonants.
    **i.** Make a list of all correspondence sets in the data that involve _s._
    **ii.** Make a list of all correspondence sets involving any of the other consonants in these _s_ sets.
    **iii.** Provide reconstructions for all of your correspondence sets. (There is no complementary distribution
       here.)
    Using rules, list all sound changes that affected your proto consonants in each language. Describe in words
    the rationale for each of your reconstructions.

**8. Takanan Reconstruction (Data from Girard 1971)**
    The Takanan languages are spoken in northern Bolivia and southeastern Peru. For this
    problem, you will do a complete reconstruction of the sounds of Proto-Takanan and some vocabulary.
    **i.** Make a list of sound correspondences.
    **ii.** Group the correspondence sets by phonetic features so that sets sharing sounds are adjacent.
    **iii.** Check to see whether any related sets are in complementary distribution.
    **iv.** Reconstruct a proto-sound for each set or each group of sets in complementary distribution. There
       should be a different proto-sound for each correspondence set or group of sets in complementary
       distribution. The proto-sound you choose for each should entail likely sound changes.
    **v.** With each reconstructed sound, provide rules for its development in the modern languages.
    **vi.** If any of the sound changes you list in your rules is a recognized kind of phonological process, name
       that process next to the rule.
    **vii.** Check to see that you have reasonable consonant and vowel inventories.
    **viii.** On the basis of your reconstructed sounds and rules, reconstruct the Proto-Takanan word that is the
       ancestor of each word above.
    (The symbol _ñ_ represents the palatal nasal: the IPA [݄].)

### CHAPTER PREVIEW

```
The previous chapter introduced the topics of language change and language family. In this
chapter, we will explore one type of language change in more detail, the change that occurs
when speakers of different languages interact with each other, in other words, when the
languages are in contact. This chapter will introduce linguistic borrowing, the incorporation of
forms or even meanings from one language into another. It will examine the motivations for
borrowing, the range of borrowed elements, factors which promote or impede borrowing, and
what happens as borrowed items are incorporated into another language.
The chapter will also discuss correlations between the sociopolitical relationships of language
communities and the degree and nature of change from language contact. It will introduce
special contact languages, pidgins, and creoles, which come about when groups of people
with no language in common must work together or engage in trade. It will conclude by
presenting linguistic areas: geographic regions that result from long-term contact between
neighboring languages, which leads to the sharing of features and structural convergence. This
chapter demonstrates that languages are strongly influenced by the larger societal, political,
and geographic features that define speech communities.

13.1 Language Contact and Areal Linguistics
When you start learning a new language, you may wonder why a word in one language
is similar to a word in a language you already know. This situation can result from pure
chance. In Latin, ‘two’ is duo/dua. We know this from English
words like dual or dualism. In Malay, the national language of
Malaysia, dua also means ‘two.’ This is a coincidence, a curious
fact that tells us nothing about the history of these languages, or
those who speak them.
Now look at Table 13.1. Color terms in English and in German
are very similar to each other. This is no coincidence. The forms
and meanings are so similar because these languages come from
a single common ancestor, the Germanic subgroup of Indo-
European. Their similarities are due to genetic inheritance, as
explained in Chapter 12.
Forms and meanings across languages can be similar for yet another reason. Languages
and dialects do not exist in a vacuum. Speakers of different languages come into contact
with each other: they may trade, intermarry, meet for ceremonies, and so on. The languages
are then in contact , with many speakers of one having some knowledge of the other.
Speakers cannot help borrowing linguistic features back and forth: habits of pronunciation,
significant sounds (phonemes), grammatical categories, vocabulary items, and even some
grammatical forms. Thus, contact is another source of similarity between languages ,
whose speakers adjust their speech habits in line with those of their neighbors.
Every language has been influenced by another, at least to some extent. In English, we
find many words that are not native vocabulary. For example, the word umbrella comes
from Italian ombrella , which literally means ‘little shade,’ and the word cherries comes from
French cérise. The impact of language contact is substantial and easy to identify in some
languages. In others, it is not so easy. In contrast to English, Hungarian has very few words

taken from other languages; speakers prefer to coin their own words rather than borrow. For
example, in English the word cosmonaut , literally ‘world navigator,’ comes from Greek. In
Hungarian the word ür-hajós (‘world navigator’) means the same, but all the morphemes are
native to Hungarian. Similarly, most languages of Europe use a variant of the word president
for the head of a company or a republic. Not so in Hungarian: the word for ‘president’ is
elnök , which literally means ‘first one.’
This shows that some speech communities purposely reject foreign imports. Their language
ideologies place negative values on foreign words as unaccept-
able tokens of language mixing. Sometimes government bodies
are even set up to ensure that people speak a “pure” language.
Recently, the Academy of the French Language became alarmed
at how many people are slipping English words into their French
(see Textbox 13.1). They established hefty fines for those who fail
to use a French word and use an English word instead.
```
### SIDEBAR 13.2

Considering a particular language
variety to be “pure” relates to the
notion of language ideology ; see
Chapter 11 for discussion.
```
### TEXTBOX 13.1 L’ACADÉMIE FRANÇAISE

```
Established in 1635 and located in Paris, the French
Academy is a body of forty elected officials who are
experts on the French language. Elected officials
hold office for life and are in charge of compiling,
editing, and publishing France’s official dictionary,
Dictionnaire de l’Académie française , which includes
approving or denying foreign loanwords for use
in French and making occasional revisions to the
```
```
standard orthography. The Academy also awards
prizes to French artists and scholars in literature,
painting, poetry, theater, cinema, history, and
translation. In an effort to keep French “pure,”
the Academy has taken a stance against English
loanwords like email and software and against local
minority languages including Basque, Catalan, and
Occitan.

13.2 Borrowings
When speakers of different languages interact, they borrow forms and meanings. (See
Textbox 13.2 on the difference between borrowing and codeswitching.) How much they
borrow depends on cultural and social factors , including the degree of knowledge
of each other’s languages, speakers’ sense of purism, and also the structure of the
languages in contact. Complex morphological patterns in a language can make the
incorporation of a foreign word difficult and thus serve as a natural obstacle to foreign
intruders.
```
### TEXTBOX 13.2 BORROWING VERSUS CODESWITCHING

```
When speakers borrow an expression from another
language, they insert it into the structures of their
native language so that it is surrounded by native words
and fits into native grammatical structures. This practice
is distinct from codeswitching , where a speaker, in a
```
```
single conversational turn (sometimes even within a
single sentence), will switch entirely from one language
into another, shifting all phonological, grammatical,
and lexical features. Codeswitching is further discussed
and illustrated in Chapter 11.
```
```
Borrowing is one of the primary effects of language contact. A borrowed item is
called a loan. Some loanwords are easy to recognize. In English, a person can be said to
experience angst or schadenfreude ; a language may have ablaut , and a country can be said
to engage in realpolitik. What we have here, in italics, are lexical borrowings : they are
words from one language (German) adopted into another (English).
If something is really “cool,” an English-speaking youth could
refer to it as über-cool. The root cool is English. But the prefix über-
is German; it means ‘super.’ This word contains a grammatical
borrowing , the borrowing of a derivational prefix. Lexical and
grammatical forms can be borrowed from one language directly
into another. Or they can come into one language via an inter-
mediate language.
Table 13.2 lists some examples of words from Taino, an Arawak
language spoken in the region of what is now Cuba, which were borrowed into Spanish in
the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. These are now common English words.
These words were borrowed as labels for novel items (for
instance, a hanging bed, or hammock) or for area-specific phe-
nomena (an unusually strong wind, a hurricane), for which
Spanish (and English) had no word. For more on another type of
loanword, see Textbox 13.3.
Sometimes borrowing involves lexical calquing: the creation of
a new word, or calque , by translating morpheme-by-morpheme

from a source language. For example, the English term flea market is a direct translation of
French marché aux puces. An example in German is Ein-drück ‘impression’ (lit. ‘in-press’),
which has been calqued from Latin im-pressio. The term for ‘roof’ in Nigerian Arabic trans-
lates literally as ‘the head of the house’ (Owens 1996): this is how speakers of the surround-
ing Chadic languages refer to a roof.

### TEXTBOX 13.3 PSEUDO-LOANS

```
Speakers of a language may think they’ve borrowed
a word from another language, when actually that
word does not exist in the assumed source language.
The German word Handy refers to a mobile phone,
and many Germans think that it was borrowed from
English. It does look English, but there is no such
word in English with this meaning. The word footing
in French means ‘jogging’ – again, this sounds like
```
```
an English word, but English does not have it. This is
what linguists call “pseudo-loans” (Curnow 2001: 427
discusses this in some detail).
Another example of a pseudo-loan is found in
Japanese, where the term hai-tatchi , borrowed from
English high and touch , means ‘high five,’ even
though the concept is not expressed this way in
English.
```
```
In addition to lexical calques, there are also grammatical calques. As an example,
consider Pennsylvania German (also referred to as Pennsylvania Dutch in the United
States), a language spoken by the Mennonite Anabaptists of Swiss-German origin who left
Pennsylvania for Ontario, Canada, after the American Revolutionary War. Most speakers
of Pennsylvania German are bilingual in English. Their variety of German is replete with
calques. One is the immediate future tense, which is expressed by geh ‘go,’ a development
inspired by English gonna (Burridge 2006: 183).
Meanings can also be borrowed. This can be seen when the meaning of a word is
extended to match the range of meanings found in a neighboring, and often dominant,
language. The Lakhota verb i ŋ ya ŋ k originally meant ‘to run,’ that is, to describe ‘the activ-
ity of moving fast on one’s legs.’ In contemporary Lakhota, the verb’s meaning has been
extended due to extensive contact with English; it can now be used for ‘to run for elec-
tion, to function, operate, work as a device, machine, system, concept’ (Ullrich 2008: 775).
Semantic extensions that arise through borrowing are referred to as semantic loans.
```

**319 13 Language Contact and Areal Linguistics**

```
Phonemes can also be borrowed. Chapter 12 discussed the
process by which the phoneme /v/ was borrowed from French
into English. Another example is Armenian, an Indo-European
language, which developed glottalized consonants, a feature
rarely found in Indo-European; Armenian speakers were in
intensive contact with speakers of surrounding Caucasian lan-
guages, in which glottalized consonants are ubiquitous (see
Chirikba 2008).
In addition to words, many languages borrow grammat-
ical forms , including derivational and inflectional affixes,
conjunctions, and discourse markers. For example, speakers of
Pennsylvania German freely use English well and I see in their
speech (see Burridge 2006: 189), discourse markers that are
commonly used in English. Affixes can also be borrowed. The prefix über- , borrowed from
German into English, was exemplified above. Another example is the Spanish plural marker
-s , which has made its way into Mexicano, a Uto-Aztecan language from central Mexico.
The Mexicano word for ‘basket’ is chiquihuitl ; to pluralize it, one adds the Spanish suffix -s ,
obtaining chiquihuite-s (Hill and Hill 1986: 165).
```
```
13.2.1 How Do Words Change through Borrowing?
Borrowed words and morphemes often assimilate to the phonological patterns
of the recipient language. For example, consider the word spaghetti , which has been
borrowed into English from Italian. In American and Australian English, the final sylla-
ble begins with an alveolar flap [ɾ], following the normal phonological pattern for /t/ in
this position for those English dialects. In British English, the final syllable begins with a
voiceless unaspirated [t]. The original Italian has neither of these sounds. Instead, it has a
geminate consonant, or a lengthened stop, represented in writing by the doubling of the
letter t. We can say that as these words were borrowed into English, they were assimilated
to the phonological patterns of the English varieties. This is known as adaptation : when
a foreign sound in a borrowed word does not exist in the recipient language, it is replaced
by the nearest phonetic equivalent. Words that have been perfectly integrated into the
phonological and morphological systems of the language can be difficult to identify as
borrowings. It takes a linguist to detect that the English words cherries, very , and beauty are
in fact loans, from Old Norman French cherise , Old French verai, varai, vrai , and Old French
bealte, beaute, biaute , respectively.
In contrast, unassimilated loans can stand apart from native words in their phonological
make-up. We’ve already seen the example of French /v/, which was borrowed unassimilated
into English, leading to the incorporation of /v/ as an English phoneme. Another example
is Mazateco, an Oto-Manguean language from Mexico. In that language all voiceless stops
become voiced after nasals; thus we never find the sequence [nt], only [nd]. However, in some
Spanish loans, among them siento (from Spanish ciento ), a frequently used word for ‘one hun-
dred,’ one does find the native Spanish sequence [nt]. Mazateco has been described as having
two coexistent phonemic systems – one native, and one for loans (see Fries and Pike 1949).

Section 12.2.2 explains how the new
phoneme /v/ was borrowed into
English from French.
```

**320 Alexandra Y. Aikhenvald**

```
If enough loans are unassimilated, new sounds can enter the phoneme
inventory. The English phoneme /ʒ/, which we find in words like beige and rouge , was not
a phoneme in English prior to contact with French. Like /v/, this sound developed into a
separate phoneme as a result of numerous loans. Its adoption reinforced an independent
sound change that was happening in English: the palatalization of /zj/ to /ʒ/, as in the word
Asia (see Campbell 1999: 62).
Some loanwords are borrowed with their meanings intact, while others undergo
semantic shift ; the meanings of loanwords are never fully predictable. We can see this
when a single word is borrowed more than once in the history of a language; the differ-
ent instances of borrowing can develop different meanings in the recipient language, for
example, English chief and chef were both borrowed from the same French word, but chief
was borrowed into Middle English in the fourteenth century, while chef came into Modern
English in the nineteenth century.
Some loans retain morphological features of the source language. For example,
some Latin borrowings into English require the Latin plural, e.g., the plural of colloquium
is colloquia , whereas others allow either the Latin plural or the English plural, for example,
syllabus can be pluralized either as syllabuses or as syllabi. Other borrowed nouns are fully
assimilated into the English morphological system and take only the English plural, e.g.,
diplomas as opposed to the original Greek diplomata , or pastas instead of the Italian plural
paste.
Some loans retain syntactic features of loanwords , resulting in the development of
new syntactic distinctions. An example is Tetun Dili, an Austronesian language spoken in
East Timor. This language is currently borrowing many words from Portuguese. Portuguese
nouns, like those of other Romance languages, fall into masculine and feminine gender
classes, and articles, adjectives, and other dependent elements in the noun phrase agree in
gender with the head noun. Tetun Dili, on the other hand, has no native gender system.
However, the Portuguese loanwords are now being borrowed in such great numbers that the
genders are being borrowed as well; nouns of Portuguese origin require agreement within
the noun phrase. The result is that Tetun Dili has two systems of nouns, one gendered and
one not, with only the former requiring agreement (Hajek 2006).
```
13.2.2 Are Some Forms or Some Meanings Easier to Borrow than Others?

```
One of the hardest tasks in comparative linguistics is to tease apart similarities due to
genetic inheritance and those due to borrowing and contact. This task would be easier if
certain categories of forms or structures were never borrowed, since then similarities in
these categories across languages could easily be attributed to shared genetic inheritance.
However, while some types of forms are more resistant to borrowing than others, no lin-
guistic feature is entirely “borrowing-proof.” Words of all lexical classes – including
possibly surprising categories, such as numerals, personal pronouns, prepositions, conjunc-
tions, and discourse markers – can be borrowed, as can affixes and other grammatical ele-
ments ( discussed above).
Some grammatical features are particularly amenable to borrowing. About one-quarter of
the world’s languages have grammatical systems that obligatorily mark how the speaker has
```

**321 13 Language Contact and Areal Linguistics**

```
come to know the information being expressed. Such systems
are said to mark the speaker’s evidence for the facts being con-
veyed; this is known as evidentiality. Getting your informa-
tion source right is a prerequisite for successful communication
in such languages. This is the case in numerous North American
Indian languages, including Southern Pauite and Verde Valley
Yavapai (Bunte and Kendall 1981). Because the expression of this
category is central to their communicative practices, speakers of
these languages will sometimes use native evidential markers when they speak English.
For example, if a Paiute speaker knows that a woman named Minnie is pregnant because
someone told him, he will pass the news onto another by saying Minnie is pregnant ikm: the
particle ikm indicates that the speaker learned this information through a third source, as
opposed to learning it through direct observation or by some other means. The fact that
evidential meanings – and forms – are prone to borrowing reflects their importance to
speakers who have these as part of their linguistic systems; their prevalence in the world’s
languages shows how important they are in human communication.
```
```
13.2.3 Why Borrow?
There are many reasons why people borrow features from other languages. With loanwords,
the most common reason is to fill a gap for an item or a concept that the language has no
word for. This explains borrowings such as hammock (see above), umlaut , from German, or
karma , from Sanskrit. However, there are also more subtle reasons for borrowing. Borrowing
may be motivated by prestige, language attitudes, or civic institutions.
Borrowing may be motivated by prestige. Consider the English forms for hooved ani-
mals in Table 13.3. The forms in the left-hand column are native, and the ones in the
right-hand column are borrowed from French. They belong to an era when French culture
dominated the English after the Norman Conquest of 1066, putting emphasis on cuisine
and elegant dining (Hock 1991: 385). The terms in the left-hand column refer to animals
themselves, the area relegated to peasants who had no exposure to French, or to elegant
life. The terms in the right-hand column belong to the sphere of cuisine, where French
influence was strong: this explains why they are of French origin.
The cultural dominance of the French-speaking court in administration and warfare is
also reflected in the numerous terms from these lexical fields, such as justice, legal, court,

curfew , and grand jury. In the current era, we see a different direction of borrowing, with
many terms related to information technology being borrowed from English into other
languages. For an example of this in Spanish, see Stop and Reflect 13.1.
Language attitudes of speakers, sometimes institutionalized through governmental or
civic organizations, can determine whether loanwords are acceptable or not. In many
languages, “foreign” importations are rejected tokens of unac-
ceptable “language-mixing.” A cultural inhibition against recog-
nizably foreign items and ensuing linguistic purism provides
a mechanism for stopping an influx of borrowed forms. Once
speakers become conscious of the foreign material in their lex-
icon – or grammar – they can try to get rid of it. This has hap-
pened in the history of various literary languages, including
Hungarian, Finnish, and Estonian (see Fodor 1984; Tauli 1984).
Such moves toward linguistic purism reflect the association of a
group’s identity with its own language, in contrast to surround-
ing, often more dominant, groups (Thurston 1987: 93).
As we have seen, the nature and degree of language contact are reflections of the history,
language attitudes, and social interactions of speech communities. They can also reflect the
relative political status of each group. A minor language is likelier to borrow forms from
a dominant one than the other way around. This is why we find numerous loans from
Spanish into indigenous Meso-American and South American languages, and just a handful
of loans from indigenous languages into Spanish.

### STOP AND REFLECT 13.1 HOW TO EMAIL IN SPANISH?

```
The following discussion was recently spied on a blog about the Spanish language. What does this exchange
tell us about the role of English in the domain of electronic media?
Question: I saw in a sample Spanish sentence recently that you used the word emails. First of all, why didn’t
you use a real Spanish word for email? Second, even if that were a Spanish word, why isn’t the plural
emailes instead of emails?
Answer: These days, believe it or not, email (or e-mail ) is a Spanish word, very commonly used, although it
has not been recognized yet by the Spanish Royal Academy and is considered by many to be an Anglicism.
It even has a verb form, emailear , that is sometimes used. It is one of those English words that has been
adopted into Spanish even though some perfectly good “real” Spanish alternatives exist.
```
13.3 **Bilingual Communities, Diglossia, and Language Shift**

```
Every individual is a member of a linguistic community. If a community is composed of
a number of groups each speaking a different language, an individual may be bilingual or
multilingual. Bilingualism can be individual: for instance, some descendants of Swedes in
America may still speak some Swedish, but may not use it to interact with a broader Swedish
community. Bilingualism can also be societal, when multiple communities with distinct
languages coexist and most people speak more than one language. Examples of societal
bilingualism include Spanish and English in the Southwestern United States, French and
```

**323 13 Language Contact and Areal Linguistics**

```
English in French Canada, Gaelic and English in Ireland, Greek and English in some parts
of Australia, Hebrew and Arabic in Israel, and many others.
In instances of societal bilingualism, the use of different languages may corre-
late with different social settings. For example, for many years Latin was the language
of the Church, and local European languages were used in day-to-day communication.
Using two varieties of the same language under clearly specified
conditions is known as diglossia. This is when a more prestig-
ious, and usually more archaic, form of a language is used in
“high” functions (such as church, school, literature), and a less
prestigious colloquial variety is used in “low” functions (day-
to-day oral interaction). For instance, in Arabic diglossia, the
“high” language of the Koran coexists with local vernaculars. And in Switzerland, Swiss
German ( Schwyzertütsch ) varieties are the language of day-to-day interaction in the German-
speaking cantons, with Standard German being the “high” variety. Note that the “low” and
the “high” varieties in a diglossic society can be different languages (as with Latin and local
European languages) or different dialects of a single language (as with Swiss and Standard
German).
In a diglossic or multiglossic situation, languages typically influence each other. This
usually works in the direction from high to low. For example, three languages are spoken
in Sauris, a German linguistic enclave in northeastern Italy (Denison 1971; Lehiste 1988:
53–54): an archaic form of Southern Bavarian German, Italian (the national language), and
Friulian (a Romance language closely related to Italian but distinct from it). German is the
“low” language: it is used within the family. Italian, the language of organized schooling
and religion, is the high language. Friulian is in between high and low; it is the language
of communication with the surrounding Friulian speakers and also serves as a symbol of
in-group solidarity among young males who did their secondary schooling in a regional
center. Denison noticed that Italian and Friulian elements are acceptable in German (the
low language). However, German elements are not introduced into either Italian or Friulian.
And Italian – the high language – is also immune from intrusions of the “lower” Friulian.
The social relationships between languages and their domains of use correlate with the
degree of influence of one onto the other.
In certain types of social situations, the speakers of one language may shift to speaking
another, which is typically the language of a socially dominant group. When the majority
of a community shifts, it can lead to the endangerment , impending obsolescence , and
death of minor languages. When a community loses its lan-
guage as it adopts a dominant one, it is said to have undergone
language shift. The original language may leave its traces on
the newly acquired language. For example, the variety of English
spoken in Ireland has a distinctive prosodic pattern (colloqui-
ally referred to as a “lilt”), which was brought into the language
when Gaelic speakers learned English. Like most speakers who
acquire a new language as adults, they did not adopt the prosody
of the language they are acquiring, but spoke it with their native

```
patterns of rhythm and pitch. Owing to the numerical predominance of Gaelic people in
the region, these Gaelic prosodic patterns were adopted by English children, making it a
regular feature of the dialect (also see Filppula 2003).
```
13.4 **Pidgins and Creoles**

```
In the process of European colonization, enslaved or subjugated people from many different
linguistic groups were often forced to work closely together. They frequently spoke different
languages from their fellow workers and from their employers or overseers; however, they
still needed a common idiom for the purpose of business communication. Hence the name
“pidgin” (which comes from the English word business ). Pidgins are contact languages
that are not native to any of those who speak it. Pidgins are used for fairly limited com-
munication between speakers of different languages who have no other language
in common. French, Spanish, Portuguese, English, and Dutch – the major languages of the
colonizers – provided the foundation for European-based pidgins.
Not all pidgins resulted from colonization. Trade pidgins have also developed. Among
them are Chinook Jargon in the Pacific Northwest of North America, Iatmul pidgin in the
Sepik area of New Guinea, and various pidgins in the Arctic (see Jahr and Broch 1996).
Pidgins are typically limited in their lexicon and simplified in their structure, compared to
the languages they are based on.
As speakers of a pidgin start marrying each other, and the language becomes their pri-
mary means of communication, it begins to evolve a more complex structure and
richer vocabulary. And for children born of such couples, the pidgin becomes their first
language. A former pidgin which has acquired native speakers is called a creole. An exam-
ple is Tok Pisin, a national language of Papua New Guinea. Begin to explore this language
by doing the exercise in Stop and Reflect 13.2; see also Textbox 13.4.

formation of a pidgin or a creole are called substrate languages. Some vocabulary from
the substrate language typically makes it into a creole. In addition, meanings are often
influenced by the indigenous languages that provide the substrate. Tok Pisin, which is
spoken in New Guinea, is an English-based creole. The vocabulary includes the noun
gras , from English grass , but in Tok Pisin it refers to grass, hair, and fur. This polysemy is
the effect of the substrate from Oceanic languages, especially Tolai, that has a noun with
these three meanings.
A typical creole looks similar to the lexifier language in terms of its vocabulary, but the
grammar is very much unlike it. Consider Example (1) from Tok Pisin. You will notice that
many – but not all – words are English-based.

‘I don’t know yet if I will be here or if I go to Brisbane at that time’

```
Example (2) comes from Kristang, a Portuguese-based creole from Malaysia (Baxter 1988:
213). The forms are Portuguese, but the way they are put together (the grammar) is com-
pletely different.
kora yo ja chegá nali eli ja kaba bai
when 1 SG PRF arrive DIST 3 SG PRF finish go
‘When I arrived there he had gone’
```
13.5 **Substratum Interference**

```
If a particular population needs to learn the language of a smaller yet politically dominant
group (as is sometimes the case following foreign invasions), they often acquire the target
language in an incomplete fashion, and so speak it in an altered form. The children of
the dominant group might then adopt the altered forms of the target-language speakers
and so change the target language itself. Such processes of substratum interference
have occurred in the history of many languages. Examples include English varieties spo-
ken in Singapore, Papua New Guinea, and other places, or the Afrikaans variety spoken in
Zimbabwe.
Majority languages that have dominated indigenous languages in many countries can
bear the substrate impact of the minority variety. The English spoken in Ireland has been
influenced by the Celtic substrate (see Hilbert 2008; Filppula 2003: 167). The Irish pro-
sodic patterns were mentioned above. Another example is the use of be instead of have in
Irish English, e.g., They’re gone mad instead of They’ve gone mad (Filppula 2003: 166–167).
This structure is parallel to how ‘be’ is used in Gaelic (Irish) and could be attributed to
substrate influence.

13.6 **Linguistic Areas**

```
A linguistic area is defined as a geographic region including languages from at
least two language families, or different subgroups of the same family, sharing
significant traits. The sharing is caused by diffusion , the spread of linguistic features
from one language (or person) to the next. Although
languages in linguistic areas may be from different fami-
lies with distinct vocabularies, their structures may con-
verge toward a similar prototype.
The best types of evidence for a linguistic area are not
traits that are inherited from a common anscestor, or
those that arise due to chance or language universals, but
rather those that can be shown to be diffused. Thus, a
highly frequent phenomenon – such as verb-final con-
stituent order, the existence of nasalized vowels, or the
presence of a past versus non-past opposition in the tense
system – would not be assigned as much weight in deter-
mining a linguistic area as would a more exotic, unusual
characteristic. An example of such an exotic feature is the
marking of evidentiality in the Vaupés River area of Brazil;
we will return to this shortly.
While a single typologically common trait cannot
by itself define a linguistic area, the clustering of traits can be
area-specific. When we look at different linguistic areas through-
out the world, we see that each is defined by a different cluster
of properties. Here are four examples of linguistic areas and the
features which define them:
```
**1. Meso-America** (Campbell et al. 1986). The languages of this region belong to several dif-
    ferent language families, including Mayan, Mixe-Zoquean, Totonacan, and Otomanguean,
    among others.
    **a.** Nominal possession of the type _his-dog the man_ (‘the man’s dog’);
    **b.** Body-part nouns being used as markers of spatial relationships (e.g., ‘head’ for ‘on top of’);
    **c.** Vigesimal numeral systems (i.e., systems of counting based on twenty as opposed to ten);
    **d.** Basic constituent orders that are not verb-final;
    **e.** Numerous **lexical collocations** , or ways of expressing particular concepts that are com-
       mon throughout the Meso-American area, e.g., ‘knee’ as ‘head of the leg,’ or ‘boa-con-
       strictor’ as ‘deer-snake.’
**2. The Balkan Peninsula**. All the languages belonging to the Balkan linguistic area are
    Indo-European, but from different subgroups. The Slavic languages include Serbian,
    Croatian, Bulgarian, and Macedonian; there is also Romanian (a Romance language), Greek,
    and Albanian. Some scholars add to this Romani (the language of the Gypsies, from the
    Indo-Aryan branch of Indo-European) and Turkish, an unrelated Turkic language.

a. A central vowel /ɨ/ or /ə/ (absent from Greek and Macedonian);
b. A single affix that is used for both the dative and the genitive cases;
c. Articles that follow the noun (absent from Greek);
d. A future tense marked by an auxiliary corresponding to ‘want’ or ‘have’ (absent from
Bulgarian and Macedonian);
e. The use of the auxiliary verb corresponding to ‘have’ in constructions of the type I have
gone in English (i.e., perfect aspect constructions);
f. The absence of infinitives in complement clauses;
g. The use of a pronoun in addition to a full noun phrase to refer to an animate object, so
that the object is marked twice (Friedman 2006).
```
**3. The Vaupés River Basin in Brazil and Colombia**. Languages from this region belong
    to the genetically unrelated Tucanoan and Arawak families. The area is characterized by
    obligatory societal multilingualism, based on the principle of **linguistic exogamy:** one
    can only marry someone who speaks a different language.

```
a. Nasalization that occurs on most or all segments in a word;
b. Four to five evidential morphemes, which mark the way in which the speaker has acquired
the information (whether seen, heard, inferred, assumed, or learned from someone else);
c. Numerous classifiers used with demonstratives, numerals, and in possessive
constructions;
d. Small systems of genders in verbal agreement;
e. Nominative-accusative case-marking;
f. A single locative case-marker that indicates direction (‘to’), location (‘in, at’), and source
(‘from’);
g. Numerous lexical collocations, e.g., ‘father of goods’ = ‘rich man.’
```
**4. South Asia** (Emeneau 1956; Masica 1976, 2001 ). This linguistic area is composed of lan-
    guages from the Indo-Aryan, Dravidian, Munda, and Tibeto-Burman families.

```
a. Retroflex consonants, especially stops;
b. Dative-subject constructions (where some subject arguments are marked with the dative
case);
c. A compound verb construction whereby a special auxiliary combines with the immedi-
ately preceding main verb and the two verbs refer to a single event;
d. The use of an affix to mark causation;
e. Verb-final constituent order.
It is important to reiterate that no single one of the features is found only in the par-
ticular linguistic area, as you can find similar features throughout the world. However,
the clustering of the properties is area-specific; it is only in the particular area that the
whole set of properties recur in language after language. In a situation of intensive lan-
guage contact within a linguistic area, the gradual convergence of languages may result
in structural isomorphism. In such a case, the grammar and the semantics of one
language are almost fully replicated in another. To explore an example of this, see Stop
and Reflect 13.3.
```

**328 Alexandra Y. Aikhenvald**

### STOP AND REFLECT 13.3 STRUCTURAL ISOMORPHISM

```
A striking example of structural isomorphism comes from two languages spoken within the Vaupés River
Basin linguistic area. Consider the two sentences below, both taken from traditional stories involving a female
cannibal. Example (3) is from Tariana, an Arawak language, and (4) is from Tucano, a Tucanoan language,
which is in constant contact with Tariana. Compare the content and order of the morphemes in these two
examples; what do you notice?

nese pa:ma di-na du-yana-sita-pidana

```
```
Figure 13.2 Tariana men from Santa Rosa, who have Tariana as their first language and who also
speak Wanano, Desano, and Piratapuya. The women speak Piratapuya, Wanano, Siriano (Tucanoan),
and Baniwa (Arawak), but hardly any Tariana. Everyone also knows Tucano, and most people know
Portuguese.
```

**329 13 Language Contact and Areal Linguistics**

```
Linguistic convergence does not always result in the creation of identical grammars. It is
also not the case that categories in language contact always match. Languages in contact
often maintain some distinct typological traits. This can be seen from in Stop and Reflect
13.3: Tariana maintains its prefixes, and Tucano its suffixes.
Examples of convergence within linguistic areas show that languages may come to
be structurally similar due to areal diffusion, notwithstanding the original differences
between them.
```
### CHAPTER SUMMARY

```
Languages and their speakers do not exist in a vacuum. Different linguistic
communities frequently come into contact with each other. Their languages are then
in contact, with many speakers of one language having some knowledge of the other.
Speakers naturally borrow linguistic features back and forth; habits of pronunciation,
significant sounds (phonemes), grammatical categories, vocabulary items, and even
some grammatical forms are taken from one language and applied in another.
Here are some of the general principles that have been presented:
```
```
t Languages reflect the sociolinguistic history of their speakers. If one language commu-
nity dominates the other, we expect the language of the dominant group to have more
impact than the language of the other group.
t Language contact may result in direct diffusion (borrowed lexical and grammatical forms)
and indirect diffusion (borrowed or calqued patterns).
t Language contact may result in the creation of pidgins and creoles. These are nongenetic
in their origins and do not belong to any linguistic family.
t Languages may share features, or combinations of features, as members of an extensive
linguistic area.
t Convergence within linguistic areas and contact situations may result in one language
adopting the structure of the other. Or it may result in one language adopting new patterns
and forms, while at the same time preserving some of its own properties. The outcomes of
convergent development depend on the degrees of dominance within each area.

### EXERCISES

1. When words are borrowed into a language, they can retain their basic meanings but take on different
    stylistic connotations. This is often the case with French and Latin loans in English.
       A prominent linguist was asked to write a grant proposal for a high-status grant-giving agency. He then
    was asked to write a popular article for a students’ magazine on the same topic as his grant proposal. Two
    extracts from the grant application and two from the popular article are given below.
    **Extract 1**
    _In similar fashion, scholars have demonstrated the genetic unity of Australian languages._
    **Extract 2**
    _In exactly the same way, linguists have shown that almost all the languages of Australia belong to one_
    _language family._
    **Extract 3**
    _The documentation of endangered languages is, for a number of reasons, one of the highest priorities facing_
    _mankind at the turn of the millennium._

Extract 4
Writing grammars and descriptions of languages that are about to die is, for all sorts of reasons, one of the
most important things to be done in the world as we near the year 2000.
i. Identify which two extracts come from the grant application, and which two come from the popular
article. What specific features of each extract served as clues as you considered this?
ii. Using a dictionary that provides reliable etymologies (such as Merriam-Webster Online ), look up the
source language of each of the following words and state whether the word was originally Germanic (i.e.,
evolved from Old English and related to Old High German, Old Norse, etc.) or whether it was borrowed
into the language from a Romance language (i.e., Latin or French) or Greek. In some cases a related word
is provided; the words in paretheses are the forms attested in the extracts.

**4.** In Zulu orthography, the trigraph _tsh_ represents an aspirated postalveolar affricate [tʃh], the letter _j_
    indicates a voiced postalveolar affricate [dʒ], and the letter _y_ indicates the palatal glide [j]. (Adopted from

Language acquisition holds a central place in linguistics because every linguistic theory must
be able to answer the following question: how do children master the basics of their first
language spontaneously, without explicit instruction, in a fairly short time, and at a very early
age? This chapter will examine the acquisition of many areas that have already been explored
in this book, introducing some of the basic research findings in phonology, pragmatics, lexical
semantics, morphology, syntax, and discourse. It will also contrast two different theoretical
approaches to explaining the everyday yet profound mystery of first language acquisition.
```
### LIST OF AIMS

**337 14 First Language Acquisition**

```
14.1 Introduction
First language acquisition is the process by which young children come to know and
use the language(s) of their caregivers. Over the past fifty years,
scholars have produced a large body of research on the acquisi-
tion of many languages but are still far from consensus on how
to interpret these findings. The goal of acquisition theory is to
articulate explicit explanations for how children master their
native language(s), with particular focus on the acquisition of
grammar.
First language acquisition has been a controversial area
because it forces us to address basic issues about the nature of
language itself. Two very different approaches to grammar have
dominated research on language acquisition:
```
```
tIn the formal, nativist approach, grammar is conceptualized as a set of abstract categories,
structures, principles, and constraints that are genetically encoded as an innate Universal
Grammar (UG). The emphasis in this approach is primarily on linguistic form, and the innate
linguistic information in UG is regarded as the basis for adult grammar as well as the acquisi-
tion of grammar by children.
tIn the functional, discourse-based approach, on which this chapter is based, grammar is
viewed as a set of forms and functions that are constantly being shaped by the mental pro-
cesses and communicative needs of speakers and hearers as they use language in everyday
talk (discourse). This approach emphasizes the functions (meanings and interactive goals) as
well as the forms of grammar, and views discourse as the source of adult grammars and the
basis for their acquisition.
```
```
While nativist theory assumes that children need innate linguistic knowledge to acquire
grammar, discourse-based theory (also known as usage-based theory) assumes that chil-
dren learn language from discourse, that is, the speech they hear in everyday social inter-
action. We will return to a more in-depth consideration of these two approaches toward
the end of this chapter.
```
```
14.2 Biological, Cognitive, and Social Foundations of Language
Acquisition
First language acquisition has a strong biological basis. The human brain, usually
the left hemisphere, is specialized for language, and all normally developing children
acquire language on a fairly predictable timetable, similar to patterns of physical and mental
growth. Many scholars believe that there is a biologically programmed sensitive period
during which young children can most readily acquire their first language successfully.
Our biological preparation for language also entails a long period for mental and social
development during which babies and young children are dependent on their caregivers.
In this chapter it will be assumed that children have universal mental and social capacities
```
### SIDEBAR 14.1

```
You can find definitions for key
terms and bolded terms throughout
this chapter in the Glossary (at the
back of this book or on the student
resources website). Additional online
resources for this chapter include a
study guide, review quiz, vocabulary
quizzes, and data transcripts to be
used with the chapter exercises.
```

**338 Patricia M. Clancy**

```
that enable them to learn language from the speech that they hear. These capacities are an
important part of our biological adaptation – and of any sensitive period – for language
acquisition.
Language acquisition also has crucial cognitive foundations. The term cogni-
tion refers broadly to the mental processes that take in information from the environment,
use it to form representations of reality in the mind, and apply this stored knowledge in
activities such as thinking, speaking, and remembering. In order to use language, we must
be able to perceive, comprehend, plan, produce, and recall linguistic units, such as pho-
nemes, morphemes, words, and sentences. First, the human mind must have powerful cog-
nitive abilities that enable young children to isolate, store, and process these units in the
surrounding speech. Secondly, children need to understand something about cause–effect
relations in order to use language as a tool for communicating and getting what they want.
Thirdly, in order to use words, children must be able to form mental representations of real-
ity, for example, a mental image of a bottle that can be associated with the word bottle ; such
representations allow children to recognize new instances of items when they encounter
them and to think about them when they are not in view. Finally, children must be able to
discover and use patterns for combining units into larger units, for example, phonemes and
morphemes into words, words into sentences, and sentences into narratives, conversations,
and other types of discourse.
We know from harrowing stories of abandonment and isolation that language acqui-
sition has essential social foundations : children need to experience language use in
interaction with others in order to acquire language normally. Infants in normal social
environments are naturally motivated to interact and communicate with their caregivers.
Long before they can use language, the social basis for language acquisition is established,
as infants engage with their caregivers through eye gaze, smiling, gesturing, and vocalizing.
The repetitive social routines of young children’s daily lives ensure that they will experience
the same linguistic forms being used for the same functions again and again. Thus, children
learn the forms and functions of language together, along with relevant social information,
such as who usually says what to whom in particular contexts.
```
14.3 **Methodologies in Acquisition Research**

```
Acquisition researchers use a great variety of methodologies. We can distinguish between
observational studies , in which the researcher records what the child is saying and
doing, and experimental studies , in which the researcher manipulates linguis-
tic or contextual features to observe the effect on the child. Observational research
has the obvious advantage of naturalness, but the findings are necessarily limited to
whatever behaviors occur during the observation. Experiments have the advantage
of control but run the risk of eliciting behaviors that happen only in the laboratory
and may not be relevant to everyday life. We can also distinguish between longitu-
dinal research , which follows one child or a small number of children over time,
and cross-sectional research , which compares larger numbers of children at different
```

**339 14 First Language Acquisition**

```
stages of development speaking spontaneously or performing the same experimental
task. Observational research is often longitudinal, while experimental research typ-
ically has a cross-sectional design. Which method is most appropriate depends on what
question the researcher is asking and what kind of data is most likely to yield reliable
answers to that question.
```
### TEXTBOX 14.1 CHILDES: THE CHILD LANGUAGE DATA EXCHANGE SYSTEM

```
There is now a vast body of language acquisition
data available to students and scholars at the
CHILDES website. This resource includes transcripts
```
```
from multiple languages, some with associated audio
and video files, as well as programs for analyzing the
data and a variety of instructional materials.
```
```
The original observational method was the diary study, in which the researcher kept a
written record of the child’s speech. In diary studies, the researcher is often a parent, who
has the advantage of constant access to the child. Diaries are selective, however, and tend
to be biased toward new or advanced language, while providing little or no information
about the speech addressed to the child. Recordings of speech are now the preferred obser-
vational methodology (see Textbox 14.1). Recordings are objective and comprehensive,
including all participants’ speech; they are also independently verifiable, since transcripts
can be checked for accuracy against the original recordings. On the other hand, the types
of contexts recorded tend to be limited and the amount of data sparse, usually just a few
hours of speech per month. The introduction of dense sampling , that is, collecting and
transcribing at least five hours per week of a child’s verbal interactions, is an expensive,
labor-intensive methodology, but one that yields a finer-grained, more reliable record of
development (Lieven and Behrens 2012).
Experimental research encompasses a wide range of methodologies and types of tasks. In
comprehension experiments, for example, children may be prompted to use toy figures to
act out sentences they hear. In production experiments, children may be prompted to tell
a narrative using a picture book, describe an event after being taught invented words, such
as Mickey slooped (= catapulted with a lever) the ball , or simply describe an object in tasks
designed to elicit particular forms, e.g., the horse that’s wearing a hat. In judgment tasks, chil-
dren may be asked to assess the grammaticality of sentences in various ways, for example,
by correcting a puppet that makes grammatical errors while attempting to speak English.
Ingenious technologies have been used to study infants, as in studies of high-amplitude
sucking (infants suck on an artificial nipple faster when they hear a new sound), head turn
preferences (infants turn their head to activate one of two audio speakers, e.g., the one
that plays their mother’s voice versus that of a different speaker), and preferential looking
(infants listening to speech with two screens in view will gaze longer at the one that accu-
rately depicts what they are hearing). Although less natural than spontaneous language use,
experiments can yield valuable and sometimes surprising findings that could not have been
discovered using observational methods.

developmental milestones. Since individual children vary greatly in the age at which they
attain these milestones, the age ranges given in Textbox 14.2 are rough approximations. In
the sequence of development, changes take place simultaneously across different areas, from
the mastery of speech sounds (phonology) to the construction of narratives (discourse).
Development proceeds incrementally but swiftly; the difference between the linguistic
skills of a one-year-old versus a three-year-old is nothing short of astonishing.

14.5 **Conversational Discourse**

```
Face-to-face conversation is the earliest and most common type of discourse and the pri-
mary basis for first language acquisition. Despite cross-cultural differences in circumstances,
all children raised in normal social environments are surrounded by speech.
```
14.5.1 Early Conversations: Scaffolding Dialogue

```
Babies are social creatures, eager to interact with their caregivers, but they cannot initially
carry on a conversation without adult assistance. In the following famous example, the
```

**341 14 First Language Acquisition**

```
mother treats her preverbal infant as a conversational partner, creating a turn-taking struc-
ture by her responses to the baby’s smile, burp, and vocalization.
```
```
(1) Mother and three-month-old daughter (Snow 1977b: 12)
Ann: (smiles)
Mother: Oh what a nice little smile! Yes, isn’t that nice? There. There’s a nice little smile.
Ann: (burps)
Mother: What a nice little wind as well! Yes, that’s better, isn’t it? Yes. Yes.
Ann: (vocalizes)
Mother: Yes! There’s a nice noise.
The adult’s words may be incomprehensible to the infant, but such “proto-conversations”
communicate emotion, practice the joint attention that is essential for actual conversation,
and establish the role of language in the caregiver–child relationship.
As young children begin to understand and use language, the talk addressed to them
focuses mainly on the here-and-now: the ongoing activities and situations, and the people
and objects present in the context. This type of content engages the child’s attention and
is readily comprehensible; it also helps the child to see the connection between linguistic
forms and their meanings/functions. Once children have begun to talk, caregivers can help
them participate in conversation in many ways: using attention-getting forms (e.g., look! ),
introducing here-and-now topics, pausing between turns, asking questions that provide a
“slot” in the dialogue for the child’s response, and even answering their own questions if
the child fails to respond. This kind of behavior is known as scaffolding, since it pro-
vides a temporary structure for children to rely on until they are capable of taking
a more active role in the conversation. The child in the next example is able to intro-
duce a topic on her own, and to sustain it over several turns with some scaffolding from her
mother (see Sidebar 14.2 for information about relevant acquisition notation).
```
```
(2) Nina (1;11) picks up her dolla
Nina: Big dolly.
Mother: Is this a big dolly?
Nina: Here.
Mother: Nice dolly.
Nina: Dress up dolly. Dress up dolly.
Mother: Shall we dress up dolly?
Nina: Yeah.
Mother: Okay. What shall we dress up dolly with?
Nina: Clothes. Clothes.
Mother: Shall we dress up dolly with a dress?
Nina: Yeah.
```
```

```
While examples like (1) and (2) may seem commonplace, chatting with a preverbal infant
or toddler is not regarded as appropriate behavior for an adult in all societies. Among the
```

**342 Patricia M. Clancy**

```
Kaluli of New Guinea, for example, mothers are more likely to
speak for rather than to young children, holding infants so that
they face the addressee and speaking for them in a special high-
pitched, nasal voice. Using the form ɛ l ɛ ma ‘say like this,’ Kaluli
mothers explicitly model assertive speech for young children;
for example, one mother told her two-year-old to say, “Is this
yours?” to his five-year-old sister, who wanted some of the fruit
he was eating (Schieffelin 1990: 71, 88).
In cultures where parents do carry on conversations with
very young children, the adult scaffolding seen in Example (2)
recedes as the child begins to take a more active role. As children
develop cognitively, the content of talk moves away from the
here-and-now and toward encompassing past, future, and even imaginary events. With
experience, children learn strategies for gaining the floor, introducing new topics, and col-
laborating on topics in progress (Ochs et al. 1979; Hoff-Ginsberg 1987). The turn-taking
form of conversation can be difficult, especially in multi-party situations; the child must
pay close attention to what others are saying in order to formulate a relevant turn, and
then produce it quickly – before it is forgotten or someone else begins to talk – but without
interrupting (Ervin-Tripp 1979). Both the content and the form of conversation challenge
young children for many years.
```
14.5.2 Child-Directed Speech: Talking to Young Children

```
In certain societies, adults use a special way of speaking when they address a very young
child. This register, called Child-Directed Speech (CDS) , has characteristics that attract
children’s attention, help them understand what is being said, and express positive emo-
tion. CDS also marks the special position of the very young child in society. Textbox 14.3
presents several characteristics of CDS that have been found in English.
Certain features of English CDS seem exquisitely tailored to language learning: prosody
that highlights the boundaries of constituents such as noun phrases, simplified grammar,
repetitions and paraphrases that offer multiple chances to process the same content, and
expansions that model the adult version of what the child is trying to say.
```
### SIDEBAR 14.2

```
In language acquisition research, a
child’s age is represented as Years;
Months. For example, the notation
1;11 in Example (2) means that the
child was one year, eleven months
old at the time of that recording.
Additionally, in this chapter, the URL
for examples taken from the CHILDES
database will be provided with the
examples, as in (2).
```
### STOP AND REFLECT 14.1 ATTITUDES TOWARD CHILD-DIRECTED SPEECH

```
In societies that have a CDS register, there may be adults, including parents, who do not believe in using it. If
you have come across people with this attitude, what reasons do they give for avoiding CDS?
```
```
Cross-linguistic research can shed light on which of these characteristics occur in other
languages; high pitch, short utterances, long pauses, and (in mothers) exaggerated pro-
sodic contours have been found in French, Italian, German, and Japanese CDS (Fernald
et al. 1989). But not all societies have a special style for speaking to very young children,
and even among speakers of the same language, the use and properties of CDS may vary,
as well as attitudes toward using CDS (see Stop and Reflect 14.1). While experiencing

14.5.3 Early Pragmatics: Communicating with Gestures and Words

```
Before children begin to talk, they rely on gestures and vocalizations to communicate. By
about 9–12 months of age, a child will have a small repertoire of communicative behav-
iors that engage others in interaction and achieve particular goals, for example, to obtain
an object that the child wants. Cognitively, the intentional use of gestures and/or sounds
to communicate reflects some understanding of cause and effect, and is crucial for the
development of pragmatics: the use of language in context for communicative functions.
Young children’s early gestures and vocalizations have important social motivations beyond
getting what they want; they will provide useful information (e.g., pointing to an object
the addressee is looking for) and will try to convey what they are attending to and feeling
simply in order to share their experience with their caregivers (Tomasello 2008: 123). If,
for example, a child points at an object and the adult merely looks at it without expressing
any interest, the child will continue gesturing to get a more satisfying response (Liszkowski
2006 ). Textbox 14.4 presents examples from American children
of three common gestures found in preverbal communication.
Such gestures are also often accompanied by sounds; by twelve
months a child may have a small set of consistent vocalization +
gesture combinations used for particular functions, for example,
making a particular sound while reaching for a desired object.
Preverbal gestures and vocalizing set the stage for further pragmatic development. By
about 14–20 months, most children can produce a number of speech acts: actions that
the speaker intends to perform with the utterance, such as a greeting or a request. Textbox
14.5 presents some early speech acts of American children, which may be produced with
gestures.

language use in social interaction is necessary for language acquisition, exposure to CDS
per se evidently is not.
```

**344 Patricia M. Clancy**

```
Young children’s repertoire of speech acts gives an interesting glimpse into their social
world, as well as their caregivers’ ideology. From the speech acts in Textbox 14.5, for example,
we can see that American children quickly learn to act as their parents’ conversational part-
ners, answering questions, making comments, and participating in labeling routines (Ochs
and Schieffelin 1984). In daycare centers, where the competition is more intense, children
must work harder to attract the attention of adults and to get them to perform desired actions.
```
14.6 **Phonological Development**

```
Once children begin to acquire words, their communicative problems are by no means
over, since they have difficulty pronouncing, and sometimes also perceiving, the words
correctly. Certain phonological error patterns – consistent differences between adult
and child pronunciations – are quite common. Textbox 14.6 shows some of the frequent

patterns of errors that children make when producing consonants. These patterns create
simple sequences of a consonant and vowel (i.e., CV syllables), substitute consonants that
are easier to pronounce for more difficult ones, and assimilate sounds to their phonetic
environments.
During the babbling period, babies usually produce reduplicated CV syllables, such as
[baba]. CV syllables are found in all languages and are regarded as the most natural, basic
syllable type. Children’s preference for CV syllable structure continues when they begin to
produce words. Children create CV syllables by failing to pronounce the final consonant of
CVC syllables, e.g., saying [no] for nose [noz], and by producing a single consonant instead
of a consonant cluster, e.g., [pe] for play [ple].

(Adapted from Dodd et al. 2006; Ingram 1986)
```
```
Young children also frequently use sound substitutions , producing sounds that are
easier to articulate instead of more challenging ones. Stops, which are produced with a
complete, quick closure and release at the place of articulation, are apparently easier for
most children to produce than fricatives or affricates, which involve holding an incomplete
closure while the air passes through. Accordingly, a common pattern is stopping: using
a stop instead of a fricative or other type of consonant, e.g., see [si] ĺ [di]. Some children
use fronting: producing consonants farther to the front of the mouth, for example, pro-
nouncing car [ka݋] as [da] by replacing velar [k] with alveolar [d]. Many children have dif-
ficulty with the liquids [l] and especially [݋], and rely on gliding: substituting the glides
[w] or [j] for liquids, so that, for example, lap [læp] becomes [jæp]. Children also tend
to use voiceless consonants instead of voiced ones at the ends of words, and voiced
consonants rather than voiceless ones at the beginnings of words; when both voic-
ing error patterns are used in the same word, the outcome may confound the listener,
as when pig [pܼg] becomes [bܼk]. Phonological error patterns can also cause confusion by
creating a proliferation of homonyms: words with different meanings that have the same
```

**346 Patricia M. Clancy**

```
pronunciation. Thus, the word [ti] in a child’s vocabulary could arise from see [si] by stop-
ping of the initial consonant, or from teeth [tiș] by deletion of the final consonant, as well
as from T and tea.
Since young children have difficulty moving their articulators rapidly from one place
of articulation to another, their errors often involve assimilation: changes in the pro-
nunciation of a sound that are influenced by the phonetic properties of nearby sounds.
An interesting type of long-distance assimilation found in
children’s speech is consonant harmony: one consonant is
produced with the same place or manner of articulation as a
nearby consonant. For example, a child might say [gݞk] for duck
[dݞk], producing velar [k] instead of alveolar [d] in anticipation
of the final [k].
As children’s perception improves and they gain motor con-
trol over their vocal tracts, their errors gradually disappear, e.g.,
voicing errors by 3;0 years of age and gliding by 6;5 (Dodd et
al. 2006). In the meantime, since production generally lags behind comprehension ,
children may be aware that they are mispronouncing words. In one famous case, a pho-
nologist tried repeatedly to correct his son Amahl, who pronounced jump [jʌmp] as dup
[dʌp], stopping the initial affricate [dʒ] to [d] and reducing the consonant cluster [mp] to
[p]; Amahl finally concluded, “Only Daddy can say dup .” (Smith 1973). In such cases the
child can apparently perceive the adult sound correctly but still lacks the motor control to
produce it accurately.
Although the phonological error patterns described in this section have been found in
children acquiring several different languages (Ingram 1986; Hua and Dodd 2006), there
are many individual differences in the acquisition of phonology. Children’s individuality is
evident in their preference for particular sounds and in their choice of first words; they tend
to use words that have the sounds they already learned, and to avoid words with sounds
they have yet to master (Schwartz 1988).
```
14.7 **Lexical Semantics: First Words and Their Meanings**

```
First words offer an interesting window into the cognitive and social world of the young
child. Words that are used frequently in the child’s social interactions are likely to
be acquired early , resulting in a similar list of first words for members of the same social
group. Textbox 14.7 gives typical examples found among the first fifty words of English-
speaking children. These words evoke an image of the family members, food, clothing, and
pets found in the homes of the (usually middle-class) children who have been studied, as
well as their typical activities, such as playing with toys and reading picture books with
their caregivers.
In assessing lexical development, it is important to keep in mind that for the young child,
a word does not necessarily coincide with what counts as a single word for an adult; it may
consist of unanalyzed or misanalyzed multi-word chunks, e.g., [wԥda] What’s that? and
[aba] ‘bottle’ (from a bottle ).
```
### SIDEBAR 14.4

```
Assimilation and other phonological
processes are summarized in
Textbox 3.6. Local and non-local
phonological processes, including
harmony patterns, are discussed in
Textbox 3.3.
```

**347 14 First Language Acquisition**

```
First words and expectations about f irst words can differ a great deal from
one culture to another. American parents look forward to hearing mama or dada ,
while in Western Samoa parents expect young children, who are seen as willful and
cheeky, to start out with the curse tae ‘shit!’ (Ochs 1988: 159). Whether adults even
recognize their children’s first words as such depends on culturally based ideologies
of language acquisition ; the Kaluli in New Guinea do not regard children as having
begun to speak until they say n ə ‘mother’ and bo ‘breast,’ even if they are using other
words (Schieffelin 1990: 74). There are also cross-cultural differences in the types of
words that children know; for example, Korean mothers use a higher frequency of verbs
in active play contexts compared with American mothers, and young Korean children
tend to have more verbs in their vocabulary than children acquiring English (Choi and
Gopnik 1995; Choi 2000).
A vocabulary list may reveal which words a child uses, but what do those words actu-
ally mean to the child? Young children with limited vocabularies can get more mileage
out of their lexicon by extending a familiar word beyond its normal range, for example,
by calling a horse doggie. In this type of error, called a lexical overextension , a word
is used for a larger set of referents than is found in adult speech. The results can be
amusing or even poetic, as when a child said moon while looking up at a half grapefruit
(Bowerman 1978), but may also be distressing, as when mommy and daddy are overex-
tended to other adults. The opposite error also occurs; underextensions apply a word
to a smaller set of referents than appropriate, as in the case of the child who said duck
only when hitting his toy duck off the bathtub, but not in other situations, such as
looking at real ducks (Barrett 1986). Overextensions are often based on a particular
perceptual feature that the overextended referents share with the original ref-
erent of a word ; see Stop and Reflect 14.2. Overextensions can also be based on more
than one feature of the original referent; for example, one child first used kick when

**348 Patricia M. Clancy**

```
The phenomenon of overextension raises the following question: do children who over-
extend a word know the difference between the “real” (adult) referent and their own over-
extended uses? Research has shown that comprehension precedes production in lexical
development ; at 1;4 years of age, for example, on average children can produce only about
6 words but can understand about 51–100 (Fenson et al. 1994: 66). Happily, then, children
usually do know daddy from the man next door. Even in production, children overextend
only about one-third of their first 75 words; as their vocabularies increase during their third
year, overextensions are replaced by more appropriate adult words (Rescorla 1980).
```
14.8 **Constructing a Grammar**

```
The acquisition of grammar has generated the most research – as well as the most contro-
versy – in the field of language acquisition. This is because linguists who espouse different
theoretical frameworks have very different ideas about what grammar is and how sentences
should be analyzed.
```
14.8.1 Early Word Combinations

```
For children acquiring English, the production of two-word combinations is usually
regarded as the first step in the acquisition of grammar beyond one-word utter-
ances. Recently, however, it was discovered that the appearance of two-word utterances is
preceded – and perhaps facilitated – by changes in the child’s word + gesture combinations.

First, the word and gesture become temporally synchronized so that
they are produced simultaneously; then the word and gesture are
used to express distinct elements (Kelly 2003). For example, in the
latter stage, instead of reaching toward a banana and saying banana ,
the child will reach toward the banana and say want. Two or three
months later, the first two-word combinations appear (Kelly 2003;
Iverson and Goldin-Meadow 2005). Thus, the acquisition of gram-
mar may have developmental roots in the domain of gesture.

Textbox 14.9 gives examples of typical two-word combinations, with brief characteri-
zations of their functions/meanings and the contexts in which they occurred. Since word
combinations with functions roughly equivalent to those in Textbox 14.9 are found in
many languages, researchers have speculated that these meanings may reflect universals of
young children’s cognition (Slobin 1970). This may also be due to similarities across cul-
tures in ways of interacting and talking with young children.
Two- and three-word utterances may seem simple, but their implications for the acqui-
sition of grammar have been extremely controversial. In analyzing the development of
grammar, the goal is to capture the child’s unconscious grammatical knowledge (i.e., men-
tal representation of grammar) at a given point in time. Since the child’s knowledge is
rapidly changing, it is challenging to come up with an analysis that neither under-
represents the child’s knowledge (failing to attribute to the child knowledge that he or
she actually has), nor overrepresents it (attributing adult-like knowledge to the child that
he or she does not yet have). The question is, exactly what do children who combine two
or three words “know” about grammar? For example, when Nina says plant tree , should
we assume that her utterance has internal semantic or syntactic structure, or is she simply
placing two words side by side? Textbox 14.10 illustrates some of the analyses that have
been proposed.

The first and most concrete analysis in Textbox 14.10, Word + Word, assumes that the
child knows only the meaning of the individual words, and the meaning created when
they are combined. According to this analysis, when Nina says plant tree as she “plants” a
toy tree, she knows the meaning of plant and of tree , as well as the relationship between
the action of planting and the tree. (Sometimes one of the words bears a semantically fixed
relation to the other, in patterns such as more + Word or no + Word.) The second analysis in
Textbox 14.10 assumes knowledge of broader two- and later three-term semantic relations,
such as Agent + Action + Affected Object. The semantic relations may be viewed as arising
from the child’s cognition, for example, the understanding that agents can cause changes
in objects by acting on them. In this analysis Nina’s utterance plant tree shows that she has
acquired the general semantic categories Action and Affected Object, and a rule for combin-
ing them in a particular order.
The third analysis in Textbox 14.10 assumes adult-like syntactic knowledge. This analysis
reflects the continuity hypothesis: that children have the same linguistic categories and
rules as adults from the outset (Pinker 1984: 7). According to this analysis, Nina has innate
access to the syntactic category Subject NP, which she omits from this utterance since she
can produce only two words at a time. She also has an innate VP category, consisting of a
Verb and its Direct Object NP; her utterance plant tree relies on this innate knowledge, as
well as acquisition of the English word order, in which the direct object follows the verb. For
those who do not believe in innate grammatical knowledge, this analysis would be regarded
as overrepresenting the child’s knowledge; for those who espouse the continuity hypoth-
esis, the first and second analyses in Textbox 14.10 would be seen as underrepresentation.
The final analysis in Textbox 14.10 assumes that grammatical constructions pair a par-
ticular syntactic pattern (e.g., Subject + Verb + Direct Object) with a particular meaning
conveyed by the construction as a whole (e.g., X acts on Y). Researchers in this framework
do not assume that the child has adult-like knowledge, so when Nina says plant tree , she is
showing only partial mastery of the English transitive construction. Her actual degree of
knowledge of this construction might be assessed by longitudinal analysis of her speech

or by experiments demonstrating whether she can generalize the transitive construction
to new nouns and verbs. Recent functionalist approaches to two-word combinations have
focused on the first (item-based) and last (construction-based) analyses in Textbox 14.10.
Research using experiments or detailed longitudinal analysis of dense samples of child
speech has found that children move from specific to general in acquiring grammar ,
proceeding from particular Word + Word combinations toward general, adult-like gram-
matical constructions. The process of generalization takes place gradually, with differ-
ences in the timing and content of the generalizations made by individual children. This
account, in which children construct grammars gradually, learning forms and functions
from the speech they hear, is favored by functional, discourse-based theorists. In contrast,
formal theorists believe that children have innate knowledge of adult syntactic categories
like Subject from the outset, as in analysis (3) in Textbox 14.10. From this perspective,
acquiring a grammar is a matter of activating preexisting knowledge rather than building
up knowledge based on experience with discourse.
```
```
14.8.2 Morphology: Adding Grammatical Bits and Pieces
The early word combinations of English-speaking children typically do not include any
grammatical morphemes. Words with lexical content, such as nouns and verbs, appear in
their base (dictionary) form. Grammatical morphemes – both bound morphemes, such as
inflectional suffixes, and free morphemes, such as prepositions and articles – are simply
missing. Children add grammatical morphemes to words and phrases gradually
rather than suddenly using a morpheme in all contexts where it would be grammatical in
adult speech. Children progress at different rates and show different patterns of develop-
ment as grammatical morphemes are added; thus, one child may use a in the phrase want a
+ X , while another child uses a in like a + X (Pine and Lieven 1997). Research on the acqui-
sition of English morphemes has shown that although there are individual differences,
children tend to acquire their first fourteen grammatical morphemes in a fairly consistent
order (Brown 1973; de Villiers and de Villiers 1973). Textbox 14.11 gives the average rank
order of emergence in three children acquiring English.
```
### TEXTBOX 14.11 ORDER OF ACQUISITION OF 14 ENGLISH MORPHEMES

```
Rank order Morpheme Example
1 present progressive - ing I making ‘nother one.
2 in Put my pencil in there.
3 on I sitting on my pencil.
4 regular plural - s Please give me two crackers.
5 irregular past We made a picture.
6 possessive ’s I using Fraser’s. (pencil)
7 uncontractible copula Is this mine?
8 articles (a, the) I have a cookie.
Dat’s Becky on de (=the) truck.
9 regular past -ed Did you turned it? (the page)
```

**352 Patricia M. Clancy**

```
An important question in analyzing morphological development is when a morpheme
should be treated as having been acquired. Using English data, Roger Brown (1973: 258)
defined acquisition of a grammatical morpheme as 90 percent use in obligatory contexts
in which the morpheme is required for grammaticality over three consecutive monthly
recording sessions. Different criteria may be required with different recording schedules, or
if adult use of a morpheme is variable.
Why are certain morphemes acquired earlier than others? The form, function, and
frequency of a morpheme are all important factors in explaining its acquisition
order. First of all, the phonetic form and position of a morpheme affect its perceptual
salience. Morphemes with more phonetic substance, especially vowels, such as -ing, on , or
in , are easier to perceive than morphemes consisting of a single consonant, such as plu-
ral -s. The articles the and a , with their reduced vowels and lack of stress, are also hard
to hear. Utterance-final and utterance-initial positions are more salient perceptually than
utterance-medial (“sandwich”) position. Possessive ’s tends to be acquired first at the ends
of sentences, e.g., I using Fraser’s , before appearing between the possessor and possessed,
e.g., Gloria_ ashtray. Similarly, the uncontractible copula ( Is he nice? ) and auxiliary ( Are they
singing? ) are usually acquired before their contractible counterparts ( He’s nice and They’re
singing) , which have less phonetic substance and are sandwiched between the subject and
main verb.
Morphemes with simple, semantically transparent meanings tend to be acquired early.
The meanings of in and on are easy to grasp compared to the and a – both for children and
for linguists! Morphemes that are used with high frequency on many different word stems
in adult speech, such as plural -s , are likely to appear early, since their semantic effect is
consistent across a large portion of the lexicon. On the other hand, semantically complex
morphemes encoding multiple distinctions tend to be acquired late, e.g., third singular
```
- _s_ , which encodes person, number, and tense. Finally, morphemes like English past tense,
which convey the same meaning through multiple forms (e.g., the regular suffix - _ed_ , as well
as irregular forms in patterns like _ring–rang, feel–felt_ , and _hit–hit_ ), are acquired late and with
many errors. In such cases, children may resort to **overregularization:** use of the regu-
lar form of a morpheme in cases that require an irregular form. Overregularizations such
as _goed_ are found well into preschool and beyond, providing support for the notion that
children prefer ‘one form for one function’ in their acquisition of grammar (Slobin 1986).

14.8.3 Simple Clauses: Given versus New Information
Children’s early word combinations with verbs generally consist of a simple clause : a verb
plus its associated arguments – one argument for intransitive verbs, e.g., Mommy go , and
two for transitive verbs like hit , e.g., She hit the ball. In these early clauses, the subject is often
missing. This happens not only in languages like Spanish and
Korean, which allow ellipsis (non-mention) of an argument in
adult speech, but also in languages like English, which require
overt subjects in most clauses. For example, Nina’s utterance
plant tree as she “plants” a toy tree (Textbox 14.9) omits the sub-
ject where doing so is ungrammatical in adult speech.
Why are young children so likely to omit subjects? One reason
is that subjects often convey given information : information
that is activated in the listener’s mind because it has just been
mentioned or is obvious in context, e.g., Nina, as she describes
her own actions. Since given information is already activated for
the listener, it is usually expressed with pronouns in languages
like English, or simply left unmentioned in languages like
Korean. On the other hand, the listener needs an explicit lexical
introduction of new information, that is, information that
has not yet been mentioned in the conversation or that is not
obvious from the context. Speakers’ different treatment of
given versus new information offers a clear case in which
linguistic form is sensitive to its discourse context.
Furthermore, the grammatical organization of the clause is
also sensitive to the distinction between given versus new infor-
mation. In transitive clauses, the subject almost always conveys given information; in con-
trast, new information usually appears as the direct object of a transitive verb or as the
subject of an intransitive verb (Du Bois 1987). Textbox 14.12 describes these patterns, with
examples from Nina’s speech.
The pattern of presenting given information as the subject of transitive verbs and new
information as the subject of intransitive verbs or the object of transitive verbs has proved
to be highly robust across languages and is acquired very early. Figure 14.1 shows the per-
centage of transitive subjects, intransitive subjects, and direct objects that convey new infor-
mation in the speech of two Korean children (H and W), aged 1;8–2;10, and their mothers.

(LP9).

```
### TEXTBOX 14.12 GIVEN VERSUS NEW INFORMATION

```
The linguistic forms used for given versus new
information reflect their cognitive functions. New
information is introduced with a lexical noun phrase
because explicit information is needed to activate the
new referent in the listener’s mind (see Section 9.8).
```
```
For example, playing with her doll house figures,
Nina (2;4) put one in a toy barrel and said, The man
sits in the barrel (rather than He ).a Moments later,
announcing her intention to play with a new toy, she
said, I will find a egg. If she had said it instead of a egg ,
```

**354 Patricia M. Clancy**

```
As Figure 14.1 shows , although they are very young, the children are already
organizing new information in their clauses very much as their mothers do. As
expected, the subjects of transitive verbs are usually given; only 2–4 percent convey new
information. In contrast, the subjects of intransitive verbs are much more likely to be
new, while direct objects have the highest percentage of new referents. As a result, the
subjects of transitive verbs are usually left unexpressed, while direct objects and subjects
of intransitive verbs are often expressed with lexical nouns. Example (3) illustrates this
pattern; the subject (Wenceng) is given information and is not mentioned explicitly,
while the direct object ( congi ‘paper’) is new and is expressed with a full noun phrase
(personal data).

her mother, who had just suggested that she play with
a barrel, would not have been able to decipher the
intended referent. These sentences illustrate the pattern
of new information being introduced lexically, either
as the object of a transitive verb or the subject of an
intransitive verb.
In contrast, given information is typically
mentioned with a pronoun. After Nina and her mother
had introduced Nina’s toy Easter bunny into the
```
```
conversation as an Easter rabbit , her mother asked,
What is he pushing? , and Nina followed up with,
He have a egg? (The bunny was pushing eggs in a
wheelbarrow.) Both sentences use a pronoun to refer
to the toy bunny, which is given information, having
just been mentioned. And both sentences display the
common pattern in which given information appears
as the subject of a transitive verb, push in the mother’s
sentence, and have in Nina’s sentence.

```
As the patterns in Figure 14.1 demonstrate, grammar functions to convey not only seman-
tic information (who did what to whom) but also pragmatic information (what is new and
what is given in the discourse). These findings provide powerful support for one of the
fundamental tenets of a functional, discourse-based approach to grammar, namely, that
grammatical form is influenced by discourse function.
```
```
14.8.4 Complex Sentences: Relative Clauses
At about two years of age, children begin producing syntactic structures that are more
complex than a single clause, such as sentences with conjoined clauses, object comple-
ments, and relative clauses. Relative clauses, like adjectives, are dependent elements that
modify the head noun of a noun phrase (NP). Longitudinal research on English (Diessel
and Tomasello 2000; Diessel 2004) and Korean (Kim 1987) has
found that the earliest and most frequent relative clauses for at
least some children occur in copula constructions that have the
form illustrated in (4) (relative clauses are underlined). Note that
in Korean, relative clauses precede the head noun, and the cop-
ula, which attaches to the head noun, comes at the end of the
sentence. In both sentences, the relative clause is underlined.

### TEXTBOX 14.13 COPULA CONSTRUCTIONS REVIEWED

```
A copula is a special type of verb that denotes an identity
relation between its subject, called the copula subject ,
and the copula complement , which cross-linguistically
can be either a noun phrase or an adjective. In the
```
```
English example in (4) the copula is relates the first noun
phrase, this (the copula subject, labeled CS), with the
second noun phrase, the sugar that goes in there , the
copula complement (CC). (See also Section 6.2.3.)
```

**356 Patricia M. Clancy**

```
The findings illustrated in (4) raise a question: Why do both English- and Korean-speaking
children produce relative clauses in copula constructions so early? The Korean data are
especially interesting, since in Korean, the child must first produce the subject of the copula
clause, and then the relative clause, before producing the head noun and copula. This is
regarded as cognitively challenging for young children, since they must hold the subject of
the matrix clause in working memory while producing the embedded clause, before they
can complete the rest of the matrix clause.
From a functionalist perspective, what is striking about the earliest relative clauses is that
they serve to direct the listener’s attention to a particular referent with the initial pronoun,
often a deictic pronoun like this to indicate a referent that is physically close to the speaker
and hearer, which the relative clause then describes. As we have seen, there is a long devel-
opmental history for this function: at first, pointing gestures that direct adult attention
to a present object during the preverbal stage, followed by POINT + label utterances at the
one-word stage, and then two-word utterances such as this rabbit or look rabbit , which focus
adult attention with the first word and then add the label for the indicated referent. The
sentences in (4) take this line of development one step further, providing more information
about the focused referent in the relative clause. There is a clear functional continuity
here, with different forms – from preverbal gesture to relative clauses – being used
for the same communicative function of directing attention to a referent.
```
14.9 **Narrative Discourse: Telling Stories of Personal Experience**

```
From their earliest vocalizations to complex sentences, children’s goal when acquir-
ing language is not to have a grammar but to participate in everyday discourse
and social interaction. As we have seen, the earliest type of discourse for young chil-
dren is face-to-face conversation centered on here-and-now activities, people, and objects.
Narrative discourse, on the other hand, requires talking about the “there and then” (Sachs
1983 ). From a cognitive perspective, the child must be able to move beyond the present
moment to talk about past events and absent referents. Children can talk about the past
before mastering the past tense or temporal adverbs, but their early narratives of personal
experience may be all but incomprehensible to the listener who is not already familiar with
the events. The narrative in (5), told by a Japanese boy of only 1;11 years old, is a case in
point; his mother immediately recognized the story of the neighbor’s dog, which had been
hit by a car, but the researcher was completely baffled (personal data).
```
**(5)** Yotchan (1;11) had been asking for another tangerine, when he suddenly said:
_wan wan_ , ‘Doggie,
_tai-tai yoo tte_ , (went) “ow-ow,”
_paan tte_ , (it went) “bang,”
_tai-tai_. ow-ow.’

```
Since the story in (5) had probably been told many times, the child was able to introduce
the main character and tell a minimal version of the events on his own. Often, however,
children under three years of age need adult help to tell stories, and the resulting discourse
```

**357 14 First Language Acquisition**

```
has the turn-taking form of conversation. Example (6) illustrates this kind of narrative
co-construction , with the mother asking questions that prompt the child’s memory of
the events, creating a familiar question–answer format to guide the narration and providing
feedback through repetitions, confirmations, and agreements.
```
```
(6) Tara (2;6) and her mother co-construct a story (Miller and Sperry 1988: 300–301)
1 Mother: Tara, Tara.
2 Tara: What?
3 Mother: Did we go down to see the fishes?
4 Tara: (nods and tucks thumbs under armpits, elbows askew, gazes intently
at her mother)
5 Mother: What’d they look like?
6 Tara: Fish. (slowly moves arms, fidgeting with blouse)
7 Mother: What did them fishes –
8 Tara: I see ... big fish. (gazes at mother, excited tone) (extends index finger)
9 Mother: (laughs)
10 Tara: (raises right arm above head)
11 Mother: How big was it?
12 Tara: (turns in circle)
I hold it. (raises right arm, palms open toward mother)
13 Mother: Was you scared?
14 Tara: No. (shakes head negatively)
I holding it. (arms out at side, palms up)
15 Mother: We seen lobsters. Remember the lobsters? They go (imitates sounds while
making biting, snapping motions with hands) like that. And that little
boy said, “Ow.’ ”(pauses) Cause it bites his finger.
16 Tara: (nods, then shakes head negatively)
17 Mother: Did it bite your finger?
18 Tara: No. Look, it didn’t bite my finger. (shows finger to mother)
19 Mother: No, it didn’t.
The mother’s contributions in (6) indirectly tell the child what counts as a story worth
telling, and what kinds of information a story should include: what happened and how
the child felt about it. Her questions support two basic functions of narratives of personal
experience: the referential function , i.e., recounting who did what to whom in the
sequence of events that comprise the plot, and the evaluative function , i.e., conveying
the significance or point of the story (what makes it worth telling) (Daiute and Nelson 1997;
Labov 1997).
Narrators use a variety of verbal and nonverbal evaluative devices to convey the point
of the story, some of which are given in Textbox 14.14.
In (6), the mother co-constructs the evaluative function by prompting Tara to elabo-
rate on the adjective big , by explicitly asking her whether she was scared , and by quoting
the little boy who said ouch at the dramatic event of a lobster pinching his finger. The
resulting narrative is more than a tale of holding a fish; it is a co-constructed portrayal of
```

**358 Patricia M. Clancy**

```
Tara as adventurous and unafraid, traits that the working-class mothers in this community
value highly and seek to instill in their young daughters. Co-constructing narratives is one
way in which caregivers use language to socialize young children to the ideologies
of their social group and to identities shaped by those ideologies. In telling stories
of personal experience, child narrators are constructing their own identity, a constantly
evolving version of who they are, through interaction with others (Kyratzis 2000; Bamberg
and Georgakopoulous 2008).
```
14.10 **Theories of Language Acquisition**

```
Every linguistic theory must offer some explanation for how children acquire their first
language. For decades, the primary focus of theoreticians has been the acquisition of gram-
mar; the longest-standing controversy centers on the relative importance of nature
versus nurture. Textbox 14.15 presents four essential components of any acquisition the-
ory. With respect to nature, the question is: What innate endowments does every child
bring to the task of language acquisition? The nurture component of acquisition theory
addresses the properties of the environment that are assumed to be relevant, for example,
the language that the child is exposed to. Every theory must postulate specific mechanisms
that are responsible for how grammatical knowledge is acquired. The final component – the
theory’s assumptions about adult grammar – has the greatest impact on acquisition theory,
shaping how the balance between nature and nurture is conceptualized, and what kinds
of acquisition mechanisms it makes sense to postulate. As long as scholars have different

### TEXTBOX 14.15 FOUR ESSENTIAL COMPONENTS OF ACQUISITION THEORY

**1.** Nature: the child’s innate capacities relevant to
    language acquisition
**2.** Nurture: the properties of the environment relevant
    to language acquisition
       **3.** Acquisition mechanisms: the specific means by which
          the child comes to have and use linguistic knowledge
       **4.** Adult grammar: theoretical assumptions made
          about the language that the child is in the process of
          acquiring

```
views of adult grammar, their theories of how children acquire grammar will necessarily
differ as well.
Acquisition theories can be viewed as falling into two basic types: formal, nativist theo-
ries and functional, discourse-based theories. Nativist theories emphasize grammatical form
and assume that innate linguistic knowledge is primarily responsible for children’s
acquisition of grammar. For proponents of nativist theories, the term “innate linguistic
knowledge” refers to unconscious knowledge of grammatical categories, structures, and
principles that are assumed to be part of the human genetic make-up, which is referred to
as Universal Grammar (UG). In this type of theory, which originated with Chomsky (1965),
grammar is conceptualized as an abstract formal system whose form is not affected by the
functions it serves in discourse. Just as grammar is viewed as being independent from dis-
course, language itself is regarded as a unique, self-contained module in the human mind,
separate from cognition. Although the child’s linguistic environment is recognized as nec-
essary for the acquisition of one language rather than another, in the balance between
nature and nurture, innate linguistic knowledge is given much more explanatory
weight than environmental factors in nativist theories.
Chomsky argued that the speech children hear is too filled with grammatical errors and
disfluencies to provide an adequate basis for learning grammar. Furthermore, he claimed,
children must acquire universal linguistic structures and principles that are too abstract to
be learned directly from speech, an argument referred to as the poverty of the stimulus.
The abstractness of the structures is necessary if the goal is to devise only one set of structures
and principles that can apply to all languages. As a solution to the supposed inadequacy of
the speech children hear, Chomsky proposed that all children are born with such an
abstract structure: an innate Universal Grammar , which incorporates the linguistic
categories, principles, and constraints that provide the foundation for the grammars of all
languages. Since proponents of UG assume that language cannot be learned directly from
the surrounding speech, they reason that it must be acquired by unique mechanisms that
are specific to language rather than by general learning mechanisms. The acquisition mech-
anisms that have been proposed include maturation of innate grammatical knowledge, and
triggering by the speech that the child hears of particular innate options. Textbox 14.16
describes how a nativist approach might explain children’s subjectless sentences in terms of
triggering, as compared with a functional interpretation. In general, in a nativist theoretical
framework, the role of learning is minimized, and children’s social and cognitive devel-
opment is viewed as irrelevant to their acquisition of grammar. The dominant metaphor
is physical maturation: innate linguistic structure unfolding over time, like puberty, with
minimal environmental influence.
In functional discourse-based theory , grammar is viewed as a system of communi-
cation that is shaped by human cognition and communication. Grammar is understood
to include both structural forms and their discourse functions; these forms and functions
are subject to the limitations of human cognition and are shaped by the communicative
needs of language users. Grammar is not sharply differentiated from discourse; instead,
grammatical structure is regarded as “frozen discourse,” the crystallization over time of
common patterns in talk. In this kind of theory, the differences between languages are
```

**360 Patricia M. Clancy**

```
seen as different responses to one or more functional forces that shape linguistic structure
over time, for example, the communicative motivation to express given information in a
reduced way, either with pronouns as in English, or ellipsis (non-mention) as in Spanish. In
this theoretical framework, the environment – nurture – is accorded a very impor-
tant role in acquisition.
```
```
Decades of empirical research have shown that the speech addressed to young children is
grammatical, simple, and fluent; the here-and-now content of Child-Directed Speech helps
children to see the relation between grammatical forms and their functions. No preexist-
ing innate linguistic knowledge or Universal Grammar is assumed. Instead, the innate
endowment of the child is considered to be human cognition, which has evolved
along with human culture, social interaction, and communication, and therefore
includes the cognitive mechanisms necessary for learning and using language.
Thus, both functionalist and nativist theories agree that language acquisition has innate
foundations; however, the two approaches differ in their degree of emphasis on innate
factors and in how specialized those factors are. Nativist approaches assume that our bio-
logical capacity for language is very specifically linguistic (UG), while functionalist the-
ory assumes that non-linguistic (general) cognition is essential to language learning and
use. Furthermore, in a functional, discourse-based approach, the endpoint of acquisition
is viewed concretely – as knowledge of a particular grammar and how to use it; there is no
need to posit that the grammar of any particular language incorporates structures and prin-
ciples that are so abstract that they could apply to all languages, raising the possibility that
children cannot learn them from the speech they hear.
```
### TEXTBOX 14.16 SUBJECTLESS SENTENCES: TWO APPROACHES

```
Young children often produce sentences without a
subject, e.g., Nina’s utterance plant tree , said while
planting a toy tree. While this would be grammatical in
certain languages, such as Korean or Spanish, in others,
like English, it is not. Both nativist and functional
theorists have sought to explain these early subjectless
sentences.
An influential nativist account (Hyams 1986), now
modified (see Hyams 2011), assumes that there is
an innate distinction between languages that allow
subjectless sentences, like Japanese, and those that do
not, like English. In this account, all children start out
with this distinction set to the default option, which
is allowing subjectless sentences; children acquiring
Japanese or Spanish have the appropriate adult setting.
Children acquiring a language like English must switch
to the setting that requires subjects; this change is
triggered when specific information is encountered in
adult speech, e.g., semantically empty subjects, as in
```
```
the sentence It’s raining. While other potential triggers
have also been proposed, the key point is that learning
per se is not involved; the two available possibilities are
innately specified, and the correct setting is triggered
by adult speech, rather than learned from it.
In contrast, functional discourse-based theories
of first language acquisition have looked to prosodic
and discourse factors, as well as learning, to explain
children’s subjectless sentences. If they are sensitive to
the distinction between given versus new information
in discourse, children will not express subjects that
convey given information that can be taken for granted
in context; this is what both adults and children do in
Korean (Clancy 2007). Prosodic factors, such as omitting
unstressed pronouns in English, are also involved
(Gerken 1991). Even in languages that permit subjectless
sentences, their actual frequency in children’s speech
mirrors that in adult speech, indicating that language-
specific learning is playing an important role (Kim 2000).
```

**361 14 First Language Acquisition**

```
With this view of what needs to be acquired and the kind of information that is available,
it becomes plausible to postulate that children can learn grammar from everyday talk.
Language acquisition is viewed as learning, and the acquisition mechanisms that have been
proposed include learning processes that are not necessarily specific to grammar or even to
language, but rather include general cognitive processes such as category formation, pat-
tern recognition, analogy, and the formation of mental representations based on specific
instances (exemplars) of language use. The dominant metaphor is construction: children as
active learners, building up a grammar based on the speech they hear in order to commu-
nicate with the members of their social group.
```
### CHAPTER SUMMARY

```
In this chapter, we have explored some of the key theoretical issues and empirical findings
in the field of first language acquisition. Building on strong biological, cognitive, and
social foundations, one-year-olds begin to communicate using gestures, gesture + word
combinations, and one-word speech acts. In developing a lexicon, young children face the
cognitive task of figuring out the appropriate extension of each word, in addition to the
challenge of constructing a systematic phonology for perceiving and pronouncing words.
The acquisition of grammar proceeds gradually, from simple word-based patterns to
constructions that relate syntactic structures with clause-level meanings. As they acquire
syntax, children are sensitive to the distribution of given and new information within
clauses, forging the same powerful links between grammar and discourse found in adult
speech. From a theoretical perspective, a functional, discourse-based approach emphasizes
that from the earliest gestures and words to the production of complex syntactic
structures and narratives, the acquisition process is shaped not by innate knowledge but
by the social and cognitive demands of everyday talk.

### EXERCISES

**1. Phonological error patterns**

```
One two-year-old learning English had many error patterns, resulting in a large number of homonyms in
her speech. Below are six phonetic forms – [dak], [dʊk], [dɪk], [ˡdudu], [ˡdædæ], and [ˡmami] – that she
used to produce a total of nineteen different words (personal data).
For each of the child’s forms, specify which error pattern in Textbox 14.6 accounts for the child’s use
of that form instead of the correct adult form for the intended word; for example, what error pattern is
responsible for the child’s use of [dak] for dog [dag].
Bonus question: What error patterns are involved in the child’s pronunciation of napkin [ˡnæpkɪn] as
[ˡmækɪn]?
Child’s form Intended word Adult form
[dak]: dog [dag]
tock [tak]
sock [sak]
block [blak]
clock [klak]
[dʊk]: book [bʊk]
look [lʊk]
[dɪk]: drink [dɹɪŋk]

**2. Longitudinal phonological errors**
    The data for this problem come from four recordings of Hanson, a boy who turned 2;0 years old the day
    before the first recording. (Data from Sands 1986.)
       Analyze the data according to the phonological processes discussed in Section 14.6 (and listed in
    Textbox 14.6).
       For each phonological error pattern listed in Textbox 14.6 (e.g., “final consonant deletion,” or
    “fronting”), list all of the forms in the data that exemplify that process.
       Use the IPA transcriptions in the standard adult pronunciation list for your comparisons. Make your lists
    as complete as possible; try to analyze the data exhaustively (find all processes in all forms). _Note: Certain_
    _words may exhibit more than one process_ and should be listed in multiple categories.
       Note that two different pronunciations of the same word are represented in the sample as
    [word]~[word]. Each occurrence should be analyzed separately. Likewise, if a word appears in a phrase,
    analyze each word in the phrase separately.

**4. Narrative evaluation**

```
The story below was produced by a four-year-old boy in response to the researcher’s question, “Have you
ever been to the hospital?” (McCabe 1997: 161).
1 Only Stevie, when I hit him with the rake one time.
2 And he hit me with that big broom.
3 And she (the child’s mother) didn’t take me to the hospital.
4 Only Steven.
5 He hit me with a sharp broom.
6 He hit me with that, that hard, hard, that hard ,
7 ooooohhhhh, I got it in the head.
8 He hit me.
9 I hit him.
10 If he hits me with that once more, that broom once more ,
11 I’m going to hit him with the rake once more.
In your opinion, what is the point or significance of this story from the child’s point of view? Based
on Textbox 14.14, specify four evaluative devices in the story, giving the line number of each device.
Comment on how each device contributes to the point of the story. What kind of personal identity do you
think the child is constructing for himself and presenting to the listener in this story?
Bonus question: Why do you think the narrator calls the broom that Stevie used to hit him sharp?
```
**5. Early word combinations**
    The data for this exercise are available on the _How Languages Work_ website, in the Student Resources for
    Chapter 14. The document provides excerpts from a transcript of Nina at 1;11.
    **i.** Use the list of functions in the leftmost column of Textbox 14.9 to specify the function of Nina’s
       utterance on each of the following lines: 58, 61, 65, 77, 90.
    **ii.** Find and give the line number of one two-word utterance that does not seem to fit any of the functions
       listed in Textbox 14.9. How would you specify the function of this utterance?
    Bonus question: Find two utterances that are longer than two words but serve one of the functions listed
    in Textbox 14.9. For each utterance, specify its function and describe the development in form that has
    occurred while functional continuity is preserved.

**6. Child-Directed Speech (CDS)**
    The data for this exercise are available on the _How Languages Work_ website, in the Student Resources for
    Chapter 14. The document provides excerpts from a transcript of Nina at 1;11.
    **i.** Give five examples from the transcript in which Nina’s mother uses one of the discourse properties of
       Child-Directed Speech (see Textbox 14.3). For each example, give the line number and specify which
       discourse property of CDS Nina’s mother is using.
    **ii.** In lines 43–59, 67–76, and 94–107 of this transcript, Nina’s mother co-constructs a narrative with Nina
       about their trip to the zoo. Find three examples, other than the ones you have used for (i), in which
       Nina’s mother uses one of the discourse properties of CDS to scaffold Nina’s telling of this story. Give
       the line number of each example, specify which discourse property of CDS is involved, and briefly
       describe the role it plays in the co-construction of the narrative.
    _Note_ : In answering both (i) and (ii), you may use the same discourse property more than once, but try
       to find different properties if you can, especially for (i).
**7. Morphology**
    The data for this exercise are available on the _How Languages Work_ website, in the Student Resources for
    Chapter 14. The document provides excerpts from a transcript of Nina at 1;11.
    **i.** For each of the fourteen grammatical morphemes in Textbox 14.11, indicate whether Nina used that
       morpheme at least once in the transcript. Give the name of the morpheme and specify either “used” or
       “not used.” If the morpheme was used by Nina, also provide the line number of one correct use.
    **ii.** Find five cases in which Nina fails to use a grammatical morpheme from Textbox 14.11 where it is
       obligatory; for each case, specify the missing morpheme and its line number.
    **iii.** Find as many examples of overregularization errors as you can; specify the morpheme that is being
       overregularized and give the line number of each error.
    **iv.** Find two utterances in which Nina uses a preposition incorrectly. For each case, give the line number
       and indicate which preposition Nina used, as well as which preposition would have been more
       appropriate.
**8. Conversational discourse**
    The data for this exercise are available in two transcripts (one using American English and one using British
    English) on the _How Languages Work_ website, in the Student Resources for Chapter 14.
       Using either transcript, answer the questions below. Note that the term “function” refers to the purpose
    that the form serves in the interaction, i.e., why it is being used.
    **i. Vocatives or endearments**. One of the discourse properties of Child-Directed Speech (CDS) is the
       frequent use of vocatives (e.g., _Mommy, Bobby_ , ...), including endearments (e.g., _sweetie_ ). Using line
       numbers, give ten examples of vocatives or endearments produced by either the adults or child. What
       functions do you think vocatives and endearments serve for the participants? ( _Note_ : The functions may
       be the same or different for the adults and child, and vocatives and endearments may serve different
       functions.)
    **ii. Repetitions**. Researchers have discovered that repetitions are not merely imitations; instead, they
       serve a variety of functions in conversation. Using line numbers, give five examples of repetitions in the
       transcript, produced by either the adults or the child. What are some of the functions that repetitions
       serve in this conversation? ( _Note_ : The functions may be the same or different for the adults and child.)
    **iii. Speech acts**. Using line numbers, give at least one example each of the following six speech acts,
       produced by either the adults or child. Describe the function(s) served by each of the examples. (Refer
       to Textbox 14.5 for examples of common one-word speech acts.)

### CHAPTER PREVIEW

```
As we have seen in earlier chapters, language is a complex array of many different
components, ranging from individual sounds to the appropriateness of a particular utterance
or sentence in a given situation or culture. In this chapter we will look at the issues involved in
learning or acquiring a second language as an adolescent or adult learner. A key question with
regard to second language acquisition (SLA) is: Why do people acquire a first language
with little conscious effort, while it is so difficult to master all of the aspects of a second
language and speak it like a native speaker?
This chapter will first discuss the main linguistic issues concerning how second languages
are acquired (e.g., phonology, morphology, syntax, lexicon/vocabulary, pragmatics). It will
then describe some of the influences from the field of psychology on the study of SLA and will
examine the cognitive processes that differ between first language ( L1 ) and second language
( L2 ) learning. Thirdly, the chapter will consider how social and affective issues of L2 learning
have come to the forefront in the last decades. Finally, interspersed throughout the chapter
are discussions of the relationship between current knowledge about how second languages
are acquired and the practice of language teaching, including some of the current issues in
language teaching, especially those arising from increased globalization.
```

**367 15 Second Language Acquisition**

### LIST OF AIMS

```
At the end of this chapter, students will be able to:
texplain the “nature versus nurture” argument in terms of second language acquisition;
texplain why learning pronunciation of a second language is more difficult than learning
that of one’s first or native language;
tdescribe what developing vocabulary knowledge involves beyond word definitions;
texplain the distinctions between form, meaning, and use in acquiring grammatical
competence;
tgive examples of sociolinguistic/pragmatic/cultural differences that would make the
same utterance that one might use in one’s native language inappropriate in a second
language.
```
```
15.1 Introduction
Many of us grew up hearing and speaking only one language,
our “native language,” “mother tongue,” or L1. Others, the
lucky ones, heard and spoke more than one language as chil-
dren (see Stop and Reflect 15.1). As we progress into the twen-
ty-first century, children in many parts of the world, including
the United States, grow up speaking more than one language for
a variety of reasons (e.g., their community is multilingual, they
or their parents are immigrants, they learn foreign languages in
school).
```
### SIDEBAR 15.1

```
You can find definitions for key
terms and bolded terms throughout
this chapter in the Glossary (at the
back of this book or on the student
resources website). Additional online
resources for this chapter include
a study guide, review quiz, and
vocabulary quizzes.
```
### STOP AND REFLECT 15.1 YOUR EXPERIENCE WITH LANGUAGE LEARNING

```
If you have learned a language other than your mother tongue, at what age did you start? Were you able
to learn this second (or third) language as perfectly and with as little conscious effort as the first? Which
aspects of learning your second language were easy? What was more difficult? Think about how you learned
vocabulary, pronunciation, grammar, and knowing how to talk to your friends versus knowing how to talk
with adult strangers. Can you hypothesize why certain aspects of language were easier to learn than others?
```

No matter how many languages one grew up with, many adults want to learn other lan-
guages for various reasons. As a result, numerous commercial products and websites aim
to address this need. Some promise that you can learn a new language effortlessly, without
translation, painful memorization, or boring grammar drills. All you have to do is tap your
innate language-learning ability, and learning a second language will be as natural and
painless as learning your first. But as we will see, successful second language learning
depends on a complex array of linguistic, social, cognitive, and affective variables.
Because excellent language teachers understand this, they design classes using teaching
methods that address all these aspects of language learning. Textbox 15.1 discusses careers
in SLA and language teaching more generally.

15.2 **Linguistic Issues in Second Language Acquisition (SLA)**

```
As adults, most of us do not consciously remember how we learned our first language. It
seems that we did not have to memorize vocabulary, learn grammar rules, or think con-
sciously about how to speak politely to our elders. Learning, or acquisition of L1, was effort-
less (see Textbox 15.2). But learning a second language seems very different and much more
difficult. Many issues arise for second language learners. The type of explanation that is
appropriate for each issue depends on the aspect of language it involves.
```
15.2.1 Phonology and Pronunciation

```
One of the most interesting questions regarding L2 phonology and pronunciation is why
attaining native-like pronunciation presents one of the greatest challenges to second lan-
guage learners. Almost everyone has known immigrants to their home country who have
lived there for many years, and although the grammar and vocabulary of the new language
they acquired may be excellent, they may still have noticeable differences in their pho-
netics and phonology that mark them as non-native speakers.
Often most noticeably, these differences are in intonation, tim-
ing, and other features of their prosody. Despite the fact that
intonation and rhythm are what infants react to first before
they learn words and grammar, these language components are
frequently the last that adults acquire.
```
### SIDEBAR 15.2

```
Prosody , including intonation and
timing, is described in more detail in
Chapter 10.
```
### TEXTBOX 15.1 CAREERS IN SECOND LANGUAGE ACQUISITION

```
Students interested in linguistics and language learning
often consider a career in teaching language. In
English-speaking countries such as the United States,
Canada, or Australia, there are many types of English
as a Second Language (ESL) programs for learners of
all ages. In addition, since English has become a global
lingua franca, there are numerous opportunities to
teach English as a Foreign Language (EFL) in other
```
```
countries. Native speakers of English or proficient
second language speakers of English might well find
opportunities to teach English or work in related
areas such as language policy or the development
of teaching materials at home or abroad. Speakers
fluent in languages other than English can teach those
languages to L2 learners at home or abroad. Research
on SLA facilitates this work.
```
### TEXTBOX 15.2 ACQUISITION VERSUS LEARNING

```
Although the words acquisition and learning are often
used interchangeably, there is a tradition within SLA
that draws the following distinction between the two:
acquisition is the process of a child’s L1 development
in which he or she gradually begins to produce the
language without consciously thinking about the rules
of grammar, the pronunciation, or the intonation.
```
```
In contrast, learning occurs with second languages,
particularly if the primary source of exposure to the
language is in a classroom – that is, not a “natural”
situation – in which learners must consciously
memorize words and rules, deduce patterns in the
language, and think about producing sounds and
rhythms that are “unnatural” in comparison to the L1.
```

**369 15 Second Language Acquisition**

```
Linguists have proposed the Critical Period Hypothesis to explain why it is so hard
for adolescents and adults to acquire native-like phonological and prosodic patterns (i.e., to
“lose their accents,” to put it in colloquial terms). The Critical Period Hypothesis proposes
that there is a biologically determined “critical period” (also called the “sensitive period”)
for language to be acquired naturally. Lenneberg (a neurolinguist) proposed in 1967 that
certain biological events related to language acquisition can only
happen in an early stage of development and that children must
receive an adequate and sufficient amount of linguistic input
during this critical period in order for language development
to proceed normally. He initially hypothesized that this period
extends from age two to puberty and is based on loss of neural
plasticity in the brain.
So what are the implications of the Critical Period Hypothesis for second language acqui-
sition? There appear to be no simple or definitive answers to this question. A number of
studies have shown that the notion of the nature of L2 acquisition changing suddenly and
dramatically around the age of 12–13 due to changes in the brain is much too simplistic. It
is possible that there are different critical periods for different language skills. For example,
a critical period for acquiring unaccented speech (suggested to be as early as age six), might
be different from the critical period for acquiring grammatical competence (which may be
closer to puberty). On the other hand, a recent test of the Critical Period Hypothesis for SLA
found that the degree of success in SLA steadily declines throughout the life span (Hakuta
et al. 2003). The pattern of decline, however, failed to be marked by a sharp drop at a par-
ticular age, which would be the essential hallmark of a critical period.
In L2 research and teaching, there is a trend today toward recognizing suprasegmentals
(see Chapter 3) as potentially more important than segments for speaking comprehensibly
and for listening comprehension. Indeed, babies react to pros-
ody (as well as facial expressions and gestures) well before they
have learned words or language. Studies have shown that L2
learners who have received instruction and training in
prosody speak more comprehensibly and fluently than
those who have been trained only on segmental accuracy ,
i.e., those who have focused only on consonants and vowels (e.g., Derwing et al. 1998;
Derwing and Rossiter 2003).

### TEXTBOX 15.3 COMMUNICATIVE COMPETENCE

```
Communicative competence refers to both a speaker’s
grammatical competence (broadly including a knowledge
of rules of grammar, vocabulary, pronunciation) and
sociolinguistic competence (a knowledge of rules of
language use in culturally appropriate ways and the ability
to effectively communicate or interact with speakers of the
```
```
target language). Mastery of both significantly advances a
learner’s ability to communicate in the target language.
(See the seminal article by Canale and Swain (1980)
proposing “strategic competence” and “discourse
competence” in addition to grammatical and
sociolinguistic competence.)
```

**370 Dorothy Chun and Jan Frodesen**

```
Many L2 learners comment that their language classes do not focus much on pronunci-
ation. As a native Russian speaker learning English noted, “My English professors did not
give enough attention to pronunciation ... after living in the United States for a while, I
realized that good pronunciation takes you a lot further than good grammar.” It is true that
some language teaching approaches have placed little or no emphasis on pronunciation,
especially those focused primarily on translation of L2 reading materials and on grammar.
This tendency still holds in foreign language contexts where assessment of foreign language
skills is done largely through written exams. In recent years, however, approaches aimed at
developing communicative competence have integrated pronunciation into listening
and speaking skills (see Textbox 15.3). In addition to greater emphasis on the intonations
and rhythms of a language, recent trends also stress helping learners develop strategies to
improve pronunciation outside the classroom, such as extensive listening to gain famili-
arity with intonation and stress, as well as intensive practice on diagnosed problem areas
along with monitoring of progress.
```
### STOP AND REFLECT 15.2 HOW HAVE YOU LEARNED SOUNDS?

```
As you have probably experienced, when you are trying to communicate meaning, it is very difficult to
monitor your sound production at the same time. If you have learned an L2, which types of sounds did you
need to practice repeatedly? Were there particular words or expressions you focused on in your practicing?
(For example, a learner of English practicing /r/ might practice conversational expressions such as That’s
right or Really? A learner of Russian might practice stringing multiple consonants together at the beginning
of a word to say ɡɞɪɚɜɫɬɜɭɣɬɟ [ zdravstvujtje ], ‘hello.’ And a learner of German might practice producing
the front rounded vowels marked by an umlaut in the orthography, so as to say Das ist schön ‘That’s nice’ or
tschüss ‘bye, so long.’)
```
```
Although communicative language teaching approaches have de-emphasized “skill and
drill” exercises, pronunciation is one area in which repeated practice can be beneficial, lead-
ing to automaticity (see Stop and Reflect 15.2).
```
### STOP AND REFLECT 15.3 FOREIGN SOUNDS AND INTELLIGIBILITY

```
Consider a language you have learned. What sounds do you think are difficult for non-native speakers
to produce but perhaps not so important from the perspective of intelligibility? A good example might
be the r sound in many languages. If learners of Spanish, French, German, Farsi, or Arabic simply use the
pronunciation of ‘r’ from their L1 when speaking English, they will probably be understood; although
noticeably non-native, the phonetic substitution is unlikely to compromise intelligibility. On the other hand,
speakers of Japanese, a language that doesn’t have a phonemic distinction between /r/ and /l/, can find it
difficult to produce English /r/ and /l/ sounds distinctly. Communicative problems may arise because of the
many English minimal pairs such as light/right, bled/bread , etc.
```
```
In the teaching of English pronunciation, another recent development is the recognition
that in this age of global Englishes, a variety of accents is acceptable. At the beginning of
the twenty-first century, approximately three of every four users of English worldwide was
a non-native speaker (Crystal 2003). We can assume, then, that much communication in
```

**371 15 Second Language Acquisition**

```
English occurs among L2 speakers with different first languages and not between native and
non-native speakers. A language put to this type of use is known as a lingua franca. While
descriptions of English as a lingua franca can include grammar, the lexicon, and pragmatics,
the pronunciation of English when used as a lingua franca is of
particular interest to those involved with language teaching and
language policy. The notion of “correct pronunciation” based on
accepted standards becomes less of an issue than describing what
constitutes intelligible communication. For example, researchers
have pointed out that some English sounds that are difficult for
L2 speakers to produce, such as the th sounds (ð and ș), are not really necessary for intelli-
gible global communication (Seidlhofer 2005). (See Stop and Reflect 15.3.)
In addition to English there are, of course, many other languages used as lingua francas
throughout the world. For example, Standard Cantonese is a lingua franca in Singapore and
Malaysia as well as in Hong Kong and the Guangdong province of China.
```
```
15.2.2 Lexicon/Vocabulary
Many people believe that vocabulary may be the most important aspect of any language
that is being learned; if you don’t know enough words, no amount of grammar knowledge
will allow you to speak, read, or write the language. But how much vocabulary does one
need to know in order to speak an L2? It depends on the purpose. Some estimate that for
everyday conversation or for the purposes of reading a newspaper in English, we need to
know approximately 2,000 words (Lightbown and Spada 2006); however, it depends on
the content of the conversation and on the newspaper. Many first-year language textbooks
claim to teach 2,000–3,000 words; a recent survey of some Spanish and German textbooks
in the United States found that their glossaries contained between 1,500 and 6,300 words.
However, most of us have had the experience of being unable to hold a basic conversation
or read a newspaper in an L2 even after studying the L2 for a year (at the college level).
For English, it is estimated that the 2,000–3,000 most frequent words make up as much as
80–90 percent of most non-technical texts. But in typical L2 classrooms, particularly after
the first year of instruction, much of the vocabulary that is taught is from literary works or
for relatively specialized topics. Based on what typical students are able to read and say after
two years of L2 study in the classroom, it is likely that learners actually need to know several
thousand English words (4,000 perhaps) in order to converse about more than the weather,
one’s family, and the most basic of everyday activities.
For many languages, researchers have examined corpora to determine which words are
most frequently used in spoken and written discourse; the lists resulting from such analyses
are used for teaching materials and self-study. For example, consider the sentence groups
below taken from two Productive Levels Tests for English. The learner’s task is to complete
the partially spelled-out words.
```
```
2000-word level:
```
**1.** The rich man died and left all his we_____ to his son.
**2.** Teenagers often adm_____ and worship pop singers.

### SIDEBAR 15.5

```
Chapter 13 provides a more detailed
discussion of language contact and
multilingualism around the world.
```

**372 Dorothy Chun and Jan Frodesen**

**3.** La_____ of rain led to a shortage of water in the city.

```
5000-word level:
```
**1.** This is a complex problem which is difficult to compr_____.
**2.** We do not have adeq_____ information to make a decision.
**3.** She is not a child, but a mat_____ woman. She can make her own decisions. (Nation 2001:
    425–427)

```
When learners try to guess the words, they undoubtedly use contextual cues: associated
words (e.g., rich associates with wealth) or words that tend to occur with others (e.g., lack
of rain, adequate information ). In fact, to know a word means not
just understanding individual meanings but knowing which
words “go together” or collocate with others. Because theories
of SLA are placing increasing importance on such collocations
for developing proficiency, L2 vocabulary teaching materials
increasingly emphasize the learning of groups of words as
sets, including collocations (e.g., light lunch, slight chance, endless supply, pretty much, right
now) and lexical bundles ( by the way, give me a break, I’d be happy to ). With the development
of corpus linguistics , we now have a great deal of information about how words combine
with other words in English as well as in many other languages. In addition, corpus analyses
show which groups of words are common in different registers, such as casual conversation
versus academic prose. For example, analysis of a large corpus of conversational English iden-
tified the most frequent lexical bundles , defined as “recurrent expressions, regardless of
their idiomaticity, and regardless of their structural status” (Biber et al. 1999: 990). Here are a
few examples that begin with the personal pronoun I: I’m going to get, I’ll have a look, I can’t be
bothered, I’ll see what you, I can’t remember what. As you might imagine, the learning of lexical
bundles and other word combinations such as collocations helps to produce idiomatic speech
and to avoid odd pairings of words (e.g., big solution, make a vacation, make a party ) that may
result from L1 to L2 translation or from a limited L2 vocabulary. (For information on an
L2-specific corpus, see Textbox 15.4.)

### SIDEBAR 15.6

Textbox 9.1.

### TEXTBOX 15.4 FRENCH LEARNER LANGUAGE ORAL CORPORA

```
As noted, language corpora can be used to explore a
wide range of phenomena in natural language production
that can be applied to language teaching. In addition, SLA
scholars use corpora of the speech of language learners
to directly study error patterns and other evidence for
```
```
how second languages are acquired. One such initiative is
the French Learner Language Oral Corpora. The website
includes a link to publications that provide an idea of the
range of topics that can be explored.
http://www.flloc.soton.ac.uk/
```
```
One other area in which corpus linguistics has contributed greatly to vocabulary study is
showing us how vocabulary and grammar interact, often referred to as lexico-grammatical
structure. These interactions often differ depending on the registers of language. Table 15.1
```

**373 15 Second Language Acquisition**

```
gives examples from Biber et al. ( 1999 : 478) of the most frequent
verbs used in English passive voice in three different registers:
conversation, journalism, and academic prose.
As Table 15.1 indicates, both the lexical verbs and the fre-
quencies of passive verbs vary across registers. For example,
while be done (as in It’s gotta be done) is the only verb in conversational English to occur
more than 100 times per million words, passive verbs in academic prose (e.g., This procedure
should be repeated) occur with much greater frequency. In fact, several other lexical verbs
not listed here occurred more than 300 times per million words in the academic prose
data. And most verbs listed for the journalism and academic prose registers were rarely
used in passive form in conversational English. In sum, developing vocabulary involves
not only knowledge of word meanings but also awareness of grammatical forms
in language use.
As for learning L2 vocabulary, linguists have different views regarding which methods
are most effective. Some believe that extensive reading (especially for pleasure, because
it is more motivating) is the best way to learn vocabulary because the words are encoun-
tered in context (e.g., Krashen 1989). Others believe that learners would need to encoun-
ter the same word between six and ten times in order to actually learn the word (Zahar
et al. 2001), and therefore specific and targeted study/memorization/use of vocabulary is
necessary. Another issue to consider is that in order to read fluently (without constant,
focused, painstaking effort), one needs to understand the meaning of between 90–95
percent of the words in a text. If learners need to look up every other word in assigned L2
texts, then the size of their vocabulary may simply not be large enough for the task, not
to mention the fact that looking up so many words may be disruptive to comprehension
(see Stop and Reflect 15.4).
```

```
Of course, how much and what kind of vocabulary a learner needs depends on their
learning goals. If someone is learning Chinese for business purposes, particular terms related
to the profession would be important as well as general vocabulary appropriate for “small
talk” topics and a range of polite expressions to be used in social situations. In fact, there are
special vocational language programs that focus on the vocabulary needed in professions such
as nursing. Consider a person interested in learning German only to read scientific articles
or someone studying Japanese only to study literature. These learners have very different
vocabulary needs from someone who is learning, say, “survival” language for travel. Young
people are often very interested in learning the current idioms, slang expressions, and infor-
mal conversation starters of an L2 in order to communicate with others their own age; they
don’t want to sound like a textbook. Informal expressions, like German Was gehtab? – Nicht
viel (‘What’s happening? – not much’), will serve students better than some oft-taught ques-
tions in L2 classes, like Was machst due in diener Fieizeit? (‘What do you do in you free time?’),
which can sound stilted and unnatural. Clearly, an important part of vocabulary learning and
teaching in any language is considering the contexts and purposes of language use.
```
15.2.3 Grammar

```
In our discussion of vocabulary learning, we pointed out that the grammar of a language
is not something that can be clearly separated from meanings in actual communication.
The essential role of grammar in learning an L2 was emphasized by applied linguist Henry
Widdowson, who stated, “Language learning is essentially grammar learning and it is a
mistake to think otherwise” ( 1988 : 154).
```
### STOP AND REFLECT 15.4 HOW HAVE YOU LEARNED VOCABULARY?

```
You might have opinions about effective methods for learning vocabulary, based on your personal experiences.
For example, in your L2 classes, did you have to memorize long lists of (unrelated) vocabulary? Was it an effective
way of increasing your vocabulary? Which ways of increasing your L2 vocabulary have worked best for you?
```
### STOP AND REFLECT 15.5 HOW HAVE YOU LEARNED GRAMMAR?

```
If you have learned or studied a language other than your mother tongue, think about how you learned or
were taught the grammar of that language. What were some of the most difficult things to learn about that
language’s grammar? How similar was the language to your L1, or if you have learned multiple L2s, how
similar are the L2s to your L1 or to each other? These are some of the questions that will be discussed here.
Just how does one go about learning the grammatical system of an L2?
```
```
While many language learners associate the word grammar with language rules that
characterize prescriptive usage, current approaches to the teaching and learning of
L2 grammar emphasize not rules but rather meaningful and dynamic language
systems that change over time. What constitutes “correct” or appropriate grammar
depends on a number of communicative variables. Thus, learners need not only to acquire
```

**375 15 Second Language Acquisition**

```
grammatical forms but also to gain understanding of the meanings and uses of grammatical
structures (see Stop and Reflect 15.5). To borrow an example from our last section, a learner
of English acquiring the passive voice must know not only the forms of the structure in
various tenses (e.g., is written, is being written, has been written ) but also how the structure is
used in written or spoken English, such as to put focus on a semantic patient that is given
rather than new , meaning the referent is already being discussed in the discourse (e.g., The
burglar was arrested yesterday ) or to avoid mentioning who is to blame for an action by omit-
ting reference to a semantic agent (e.g., Mistakes were made ).
As another example, the modal verb may in English is an easy
form to learn but has several meanings, including permission
( you may leave ) and possibility ( it may rain ). Further, an English
learner might discover that speakers in informal contexts often
use another modal, can , and not may , to ask permission: Can
we go when we’ve finished our exam? As these examples illustrate,
acquiring the grammar of an L2 involves not just learning the
forms, but also multiple meanings and appropriate uses of structures in communicative
contexts.
Sensitivity to the communicative context is only one important factor in successful L2
acquisition. Another factor is the first language that the learner brings to the process. L2
learners frequently make errors that can be attributed to transfer from L1. For example,
native speakers of Chinese or Korean learning English may omit the - s inflection for English
plural nouns since their L1s do not normally mark for plural (e.g., * I bought two book). Word
order differences between languages account for many such errors. A speaker of Farsi learn-
ing English, for example, might transfer that language’s subject, object, verb ordering as
well as the ordering of adjectives after nouns in producing English utterances (e.g., I man old
saw for I saw an old man). A native speaker of English learning French may incorrectly place
some adjectives, such as those denoting colors, before nouns instead of after them (e.g., * la
blanche maison for ‘the white house’).
It is also the case, however, that many grammatical errors made by L2 learners are not
caused by interference from L1 but are specific to the particular L2 being learned. For exam-
ple, in English some lexical verbs, such as enjoy , are followed by complement clauses in
which the verb is in the - ing (gerund) form, as in I enjoy reading mysteries , and do not take
complements in which the verb is in the infinitive (* I enjoy to read mysteries ). Many learn-
ers of English, regardless of their L1s, will make errors in using the wrong complements
after such verbs until they acquire the correct structures. (To explore an online resource that
provides correction of grammatical errors, see Stop and Reflect 15.6.)
Further evidence that the L1 is not the only factor contributing to errors in L2 production
is that L2 learners, regardless of their mother tongue, master certain grammatical
morphemes in the same order as children learning that same language as an L1.
For example, L2 English learners in early stages of acquisition typically use the word no
or not to negate utterances, placing it at the beginning of the utterance, as in No have dog ;
later they may use other forms combined with auxiliaries such as don’t. The same pattern
is attested in L1 acquisition of English. Another example is that learners of English may

The semantic case roles of agent and
patient are introduced in Section
6.3.5. The concepts of given versus
new information are discussed in
Section 9.8.
```

**376 Dorothy Chun and Jan Frodesen**

```
extend the regular past-tense rule to irregular verbs, producing teached or putted , or apply
the regular plural formation to irregular nouns, producing forms such as teeths. Again, these
patterns are frequently found in the speech of children acquiring English. Native speakers
of English make similar types of mistakes when learning other languages. For example,
learners of Japanese sometimes apply the regular morphological rules of verbal negation
(using the morpheme -nai ) to the separate word class of adjectives, leading to incorrect
forms like atsui-nai or atsu-nai for ‘not hot’ as opposed to the correct form atsu-kunai. Such
mistakes are also found in the speech of children acquiring Japanese.
Another way that L2 acquisition can mirror processes of development for L1 is that
acquisition does not always proceed in a linear fashion. Sometimes learners experience
U-shaped learning , first producing a correct form, perhaps by imitation, then later pro-
ducing an incorrect form after learning the grammatical system, and finally producing the
correct form again once the exceptions to the rules have been learned or the grammati-
cal system has been mastered. For example, in L1 acquisition, a child might produce the
sequence: I have more than you (2 yrs.); I have many-er than you (3 yrs.); I have more than you
(4 yrs.). Similarly, in adult L2 acquisition, a learner may say She taught me English early on,
based on having heard the form taught ; then later, after learning to form the past tense with
```
- _ed_ , the learner might produce _She teached me English_ ; and finally, after learning that the
verb _teach_ is irregular, they will say _She taught me English_.
    The overgeneralization of grammatical rules and the observation of U-shaped learning
patterns led to the development of an important concept in linguistic approaches to SLA,
namely that of **interlanguage** , which is the L2 language system created by a learner; this
interlanguage is neither the L1 system nor the native-like L2 system, but something in
between. A learner’s interlanguage is constantly changing and is continually revised based
on new words, forms, or structures that enter the system. It can be thought of as a continuum
of a learner’s evolving L2 language system, or even as a third language, with its own gram-
mar, lexicon, and phonology. The key point is that the learner’s language at any given time
is an internalized system, created as that learner imposes structure on the available linguistic
input. As such, a learner’s interlanguage can be seen as an important intermediate stage that
is part of the language-learning process rather than as a system that is considered deficient.
This allows greater tolerance for errors, as mistakes are considered to be steps in the evolving
process of L2 mastery. Learners often experience, when learning an L2, that certain errors
persist when they speak or write the language. This is called **stabilization** or **fossilization** ,
a phenomenon that may prevent the learner’s L2 system from becoming native-like.

15.2.4 Cross-Cultural Issues and Pragmatic Interpretation
Chapter 8 introduced pragmatics as extralinguistic competence, the ability to draw cor-
rect inferences based on the context of an utterance. Culture is a critical part of the
extralinguistic context, and there are many culturally based expectations for how
utterances should be interpreted. This fact is (often keenly) felt by second language
learners – and speakers of the target language who interact with them – when utterances
intended in one way are interpreted in quite another.
This can be true of conventionalized interactions, such as the exchange of greetings,
where different greetings have different implications about the level of formality of the
interaction and the social relationship between interlocutors. For example, in the United
States the following greetings and responses are common:
How are you today? How’re ya doin’? What’s up?
I’m fine, thanks. I’m good. Not much.
How are you? can be used in more formal situations, resulting in the more formal and polite
I’m fine, thanks , whereas How’s it going? or How’re ya doin’? are less formal and are often
answered with I’m good. In the most informal settings, e.g., on college campuses, you might
hear What’s up? (and even ‘Sup? ), with a reply like Nothin’ or Hey. Speakers immersed in the
cultural context know that the question itself is often used as a greeting and is not intended
to be interpreted as a true question about how the other person actually is; likewise, the
responses are rather formulaic as well. An L2 hearer lacking this cultural context may not
realize that the “question” is a standard greeting, but rather interpret it as a request for
information. When coming from a stranger, e.g., a store cashier, he or she may either feel
affronted by the question or proceed to give a full and complete answer about how he
or she really is doing that day, surprising the cashier! A similar mistake can be made by
American speakers in other cultural contexts. For example, in Spain, when people ask ¿Queշ
tal? (‘How are things/What’s up?’) they are often using it as a genuine request for informa-
tion and expression of interest in the other person, so when an American answers Nada
(‘nothing’), the response could be perceived as cold, rude, or insensitive.
Missed interpretations can also occur in other conventionalized interactions, such as the
giving and receiving of compliments, or the acceptance or refusal of a date. People draw
inferences about intended meanings based on the interactional norms of their native cul-
tures, and they respond accordingly, sometimes in ways that are inappropriate or misinter-
preted in the foreign cultural context. The following examples, taken from observations by
students in the United States, illustrate typical cases:
```
```
t Japanese: When a Japanese teacher complimented an American student, the student said Thank
you! but later realized that this was an inappropriate response to a compliment in a Japanese
context, where it is considered polite to deny compliments, as the speaker then appears more
humble.
t Persian: When a Persian student said to an American, Wow, you’ve gotten big/fat , it was intended
as a compliment, meaning ‘You look healthy/good.’ The culturally based intended interpretation
is that fat indicates a lack of illness. In the US cultural context, however, being fat is often stigma-
tized, so the statement was interpreted as an insult.
```

**378 Dorothy Chun and Jan Frodesen**

```
t Hungarian: When a Hungarian woman was invited to go on a date by an American man,
she said No, I can’t; I’m busy. He said, Okay, maybe next time. But in Hungarian culture, he was
supposed to keep asking and trying to persuade her to go out with him. She expected him to
interpret her utterance in that way and was disappointed when he didn’t persist.
t Japanese: A Japanese man asked an American woman if she liked a certain food. It was his way
of asking her out, following cultural norms in Japan. Lacking this extralinguistic cultural context,
she responded honestly to the linguistic meaning of the utterance, saying No, I don’t like that
food. Not realizing that she did not understand his pragmatic intention, he assumed from her
response that she did not want to go out with him.
```
```
Missed interpretations based on different cultural assumptions are not limited to conven-
tionalized interactions. This is especially true when people prefer to be indirect:
```
```
t Japanese: A student arrived late to Japanese class, and when the teacher commented You seem
to be very busy , she was expecting the student to offer an explanation as to why the student was
late. Without the shared cultural background that would indicate this was an indirect request for
explanation, the student found the comment to be confusing.
t Italian: An American student’s Italian roommates kept asking her Aren’t you hot? whenever she
wore boots and jeans during the summer. They were trying to imply that she was inappropriately
dressed, based on their cultural assumptions about seasonally appropriate clothing, which she did
not share. She was not able to interpret their questions as suggestions that she dress differently.
```
```
One aspect of language use where people frequently encounter difficulty has to do with
determining the appropriate level of formality. Speakers who want their linguistic forms to
be interpreted as polite and well-meaning may mistakenly appear either overly formal and
cold, or overly informal and presumptuous. We can see this in the examples below, from
L2 writers sending emails to the editors of a scholarly journal; some were overly formal and
others were far too informal:
```
```
tL1 Arabic: It honours me to send my manuscript to consider for publication in your estimable
journal.
tL1 Korean: Dear editors, if you possibly find a time to review my attached file and give a feedback
to my current concern above, it would really be appreciated, sir.
tL1 Persian: I entreat you to consider my humble paper as an attachment for publication. I hope
these few lines find you in the best of your health.
tL1 Persian: i have written an article ... and now I wanna submit it in one ELT journals. how can I
submit it in your journal? plz send some information.
tL1 Chinese: Dear Editor, Please check this article.
tL1 Chinese: Dear Professor, Thank you very much for your immediate response and your exciting
website. Wish you a healthy body and a happy life.
```
```
One recent development in the teaching of pragmatics for L2 learners is a greater empha-
sis on the bicultural or multicultural identities that many speakers of other languages pos-
sess. That is, although learners need to be aware of practices that are potentially offensive or
off-putting to people of the L2 culture, as illustrated in some of the examples above, speakers
```

**379 15 Second Language Acquisition**

```
do not necessarily need to adopt all L2 communicative norms when speaking the L2. One
example might be the response to compliments. An American woman might respond to a
compliment about a personal item such as clothing with a comment like Oh, yes, I just love it!
In another cultural context, such a response might be interpreted as bragging or in another
unintended way. A woman who feels uncomfortable responding in such a way should not
feel she needs to give up her L1 norm of responding, as long as it is not objectionable and
does not elicit interpretations that she did not want to make. Or she might combine some
part of an L2 manner of response with that of her L1. Thus, learning the pragmatics of an L2
becomes an additive experience rather than one that replaces L1 with L2, creating a more
complex (in the good sense) and richer identity for the language learner. However, ideally,
the learner should be making conscious choices about appropriate forms to use in social
situations and not “default” L1 forms resulting from a lack of knowledge about the L2.
```
```
15.3 Cognitive Processing Issues in SLA
First and second language acquisition are important fields of study not only within linguis-
tics but also within the field of psychology. The term psycholinguistics is used to indi-
cate the intersection of these fields, including the acquisition of language. Since language
acquisition is a cognitive process, it is also of great interest to those who study cognitive
linguistics. Different people use different cognitive strategies in the process of L2 acqui-
sition. For example, some people consciously think through nearly everything they are
going to say before saying it, mentally translating from their L1 into the L2 before speaking
or writing, thus monitoring their production. Others may use “chunks” of language or
grammatical formulas in the construction of sentences. These represent different learning
processes that can vary across individuals, or which can be used by a single individual
at different points in the L2 acquisition process. There are also different ways in which
language is comprehended, including “top-down” processing where learners are able to
reach a basic level of comprehension of an utterance without understanding every word,
and “bottom-up” processing where comprehension proceeds more slowly as learners focus
on individual words or morphemes, which can be an obstacle to the comprehension of
the whole. It is interesting to consider the implications of these differences and what they
reveal about learning and human cognition.
Before considering these implications, it is important to understand the historical context
out of which the field of psycholinguistics developed. Until the middle of the twentieth
century, behaviorism was a dominant theory within the field of psychology. Applied to L2
learning, the theory suggests that if a learner hears a stimulus in an L2 and repeats the word
or sentence enough times, it will become a habit and can then be used to communicate
successfully. However, as theories of psychology evolved in the late twentieth century, there
was a reaction against behaviorist theories. In SLA, this entailed a movement toward cogni-
tive theories, including a shift in focus from the learner’s external environment to the indi-
vidual’s internal thought processes. In the cognitive tradition, the focus is on the central role
of the human mind in processing linguistic data that is heard or received as input, with a
reduced role for repetition and habit formation. SLA is viewed as the acquisition of complex
```

**380 Dorothy Chun and Jan Frodesen**

```
skills, and, like learning to play a sport or a musical instrument, the role of automaticity
is of great importance. The goal of SLA is for the learner to be able to process linguistic input
and output quickly, unconsciously, and effortlessly, without having to think about each
word or step in the process. To do this, the learner begins with controlled processing, in
which the associations have not yet been built up by repeated use and so require conscious
attention. With time and experience, learners begin to use language more automatically.
Language processing is also believed to be highly dependent upon input frequency, with
frequency effects found in the processing of phonology, lexis, grammaticality, syntax, and
formulaic language production (Ellis 2002). The effects of frequency of exposure and input
have been studied in first and second language acquisition, and help explain, for example,
the variance of morpheme acquisition order. But the main question is how learners
move from knowledge of the examples received as input to automatically produc-
ing language; for SLA, this question remains unanswered. (See Textbox 15.5 for a
discussion of how the theoretical debates between nativist and functionalist theories with
regards to language learning play out with respect to second language acquisition.)
```
### TEXTBOX 15.5 THEORETICAL DEBATES IN L2 ACQUISITION

```
Chapter 14 included a discussion of nativist versus
functional discourse-based theories of first language
acquisition. Nativist theories are based upon the view
that innate grammatical structures (Universal Grammar,
or UG) are required to explain certain facts, such as
the child’s ability to produce utterances that they
have never before heard. A functional discourse-based
theory, by contrast, would attribute such behavior to
more general processes of human cognition, such as
learning and analogy. The same theoretical debate is
```
```
found with regard to second language acquisition, and
this motivates interesting questions in both fields. If one
assumes the existence of UG, to what extent are these
structures still available to someone learning a second
language, particularly when the learner is no longer a
child, but an adolescent or an adult? Or, if one assumes
there is no UG, then how do human cognitive abilities
allow for the acquisition of the second language,
and what is the role of interactional discourse in this
process?
```
```
There seem to be a number of different mechanisms at work as learners automate their
L2 production. Two important mechanisms proposed in the SLA literature are the monitor
and the affective filter. The monitor is the learner’s cognitive “watchdog” that consciously
reviews what the learner has said in the L2 and monitors it for correctness (see Textbox 15.6).
The affective filter is the emotional component of an L2 learner’s conscious learning process,
which involves how comfortable or uncomfortable they are when speaking an L2. When try-
ing to speak a foreign language, many learners have the experience of not wanting to embar-
rass themselves. In acute cases of discomfort, the affective filter would be “high” and the
learner would find it difficult to communicate in the language (see Stop and Reflect 15.7).
Another mechanism that learners use in the process of SLA is negotiation for mean-
ing , a specific type of interaction where L2 learners explicitly signal that they do not
understand something and the interlocutor provides input as an attempt to clarify and
facilitate their understanding. This is part of a broader theory known as the Interaction
Hypothesis , proposed by Long (1996); see Textbox 15.7. These kinds of interactions are
```

**381 15 Second Language Acquisition**

```
important for developing communicative competence and are interrelated with the social
aspects of SLA, to be discussed in the next section.
Many examples of negotiation can be found in transcripts of computer-mediated commu-
nication. For example, in a negotiation between a native speaker of Spanish and a learner
of Spanish, the learner (Speaker Y) did not understand the Spanish word común , which the
native speaker (Speaker X) used (Blake 2000: 125):
```
```
X: Cuales son en común?
[What are in common?]
Y: como se dice comun en igles? no comprehende
[How do you say “common” in English? ... no understand]
X: común es cuando algo y una otra algo son el mismo; entiendes mi explicacion?
[“Common” is when something and another thing are the same; do you understand my
explanation?]
Y: si, gracias ...
[Yes, thank you.]
```
```
In addition to such mechanisms, a host of individual learner differences are also factors in
acquisition and learning. Among them is a wide array of differences in cognitive styles (e.g.,
verbal vs. visual vs. auditory vs. kinesthetic learners), learning styles (inductive vs. deduc-
tive), personality (e.g., introvert vs. extrovert), aptitude, age, motivation (e.g., instrumental
vs. integrative), and affect (e.g., insensitive vs. empathetic). Some of these factors will be
discussed in the next section.
```
### TEXTBOX 15.7 THE INTERACTION HYPOTHESIS

```
The Interaction Hypothesis states that: “ Negotiation
for meaning , and especially negotiation work that
triggers interactional adjustments by the [Native
speaker] or more competent interlocutor, facilitates
```
```
acquisition because it connects input, internal
speaker capacities, particularly selective attention,
and output in productive ways” (Long 1996:
451–452).
```
### TEXTBOX 15.6 MONITORING L2 SPEECH

```
Just as the affective filter mechanism might differ
greatly from one L2 learner to another, some
learners monitor themselves better than others.
The disadvantage of monitoring too closely or
carefully is that speakers may not say as much as
```
```
they would like. Perhaps even worse, speakers might
take so much time to think about their correct L2
usage that the conversation may have moved on to
another topic before they have the chance to utter a
sentence.
```
### STOP AND REFLECT 15.7 YOUR AFFECTIVE EXPERIENCE IN SLA

```
In thinking about your L2 learning experiences, do you ever feel self-conscious about speaking the L2? Do you
worry about how you sound to others? Do you know gregarious people who will gab in an L2 “fluently” while
making lots of grammatical mistakes?
```

**382 Dorothy Chun and Jan Frodesen**

15.4 **Sociocultural and Affective Aspects of SLA**

```
Because language is inherently interactional, the social and affective aspects of communica-
tion are significant factors in the process of L2 learning. Many important pedagogical meth-
ods rely on social interaction as a medium of teaching and learning. Since the late 1970s,
the input–interaction–output theory of SLA has been central in providing many insights
into second language learning and teaching, or “instructed SLA.” Simply put, the model
proposes that language acquisition is strongly facilitated by learners using the target lan-
guage in interaction. In particular, when learners actively negotiate meaning in an L2 with
a communicative partner, they benefit from experience with both comprehensible input
and output through interaction. Input includes all language that a learner hears or reads
through either informal or formal learning; output is simply the language that the learner
produces, either speaking or writing. Many L2 classroom activities draw on this model,
such as those in which students are given tasks to complete that require meaningful verbal
interaction. In collaborative tasks, learners are assigned a goal and must communicate using
whatever linguistic or extralinguistic resources they have to achieve the intended outcome.
In the mid 1990s some scholars moved to a more enriched theoretical approach to SLA,
believing that the input–interaction–output model did not sufficiently explain how sec-
ond languages are learned in that it was rooted in cognitive and interactionist SLA theory.
Sometimes referred to as the “social turn in SLA,” these enriched approaches were based
in large measure on the sociocultural linguistic theories of Vygotsky and Bakhtin. The
underlying premise of these theories is that language is predominantly a social tool
and as such is developed through interaction between and among communicators.
The key notion is that language use does not take place in a vacuum but in real social
contexts. When applied to SLA, the implication is that language instructors must allow
L2 learners to become active participants in the culture of the target language, while SLA
theorists should investigate how participation in a variety of sociocultural contexts affects
the learner’s L2 ability.
```
### STOP AND REFLECT 15.8 INTERACTING AS AN L2 LEARNER

```
Based on your own language-learning experience, how important do you think it is to interact with native
speakers of an L2? How important has it been for you to have conversations with others in the L2 (e.g., in an
L2 class)? Was it helpful for you to speak with other L2 learners, or were you worried that you would hear and
learn their mistakes?
```
```
It is important to note that cognitive, linguistic, and social factors all play significant
roles in linguistic use, choice, and development. An L2 learner’s interlanguage is a varia-
ble linguistic system and is created by the interaction of both social factors and cognitive
processes (see Stop and Reflect 15.8). Consider for a moment that when speaking an L1,
we do not speak in the same way with all of our conversation partners. We might speak
differently to some of our friends than to some family members, not only in terms of the
topics we discuss, but possibly also in our choice of vocabulary, tone of voice, or intona-
tion. Similarly, for L2 learners, social variables such as who the interlocutor is (instructor
```

**383 15 Second Language Acquisition**

```
vs. classmate; native vs. non-native speaker of the L2), the topic of discussion (everyday
conversation vs. literary discussion), the social situation surrounding the discourse (class-
room setting vs. authentic encounter), and the interactional norms of a given community
or type of communication (what is expected in a service encounter in different countries,
e.g., the extent to which a store clerk offers help or advice) all have an influence on our
choice of linguistic forms.
The interactional norms of a community are one part of its culture, which plays a central
role in how people use and interpret language. In SLA, most language learners and teachers
believe that developing an understanding of the L2 culture is an integral part of language
learning. The following excerpt from a student’s language-learning history supports this belief:
```
```
The [Chinese] professors incorporated a lot of authentic materials to generate interest in the
language and culture we were studying. This included samples of authentic foods to mark special
occasions on the Chinese calendar and teaching us folk songs. My French teachers also adopted
this approach by teaching us songs, having us read newspaper articles, and introducing us to
classic art and cinema. (Meredith, native English speaker)
During the past few decades, however, applied linguists have challenged many of the tra-
ditional ways of teaching culture in language classrooms, pointing out that “culture” is a
much more complex topic than merely introducing different kinds of food, holidays, pop-
ular songs, or points of interest in different countries. They have raised questions as to how
we can teach the culture of countries which themselves have such great diversity. If, for
example, we are teaching about American culture, how do we deal with the tremendous vari-
ety involving different ethnic groups, age groups, parts of the country (e.g., the Deep South
versus the Pacific Northwest), different lifestyles (e.g., urban versus rural culture), and so on.
```
### STOP AND REFLECT 15.9 TEACHING CULTURE IN L2 CLASSROOMS

```
Considering other languages and cultures with which you are familiar, can you think of cultural differences
between subgroups of speakers of the language? What aspects of the culture would you choose to teach in a
second language classroom?
```
```
In addition to the dangers of stereotyping or misrepresenting cultures, some theorists of
foreign language teaching believe that how much L2 culture should be taught depends on
the learners’ goals (see Stop and Reflect 15.9). McKay, an applied linguist who has been
concerned with the teaching of English as an international language, stresses that language
teachers abroad need to be aware of the learning needs and native cultures of the students.
She suggests that some aspects of an L2 culture may be uninteresting or irrelevant to learners.
As an example she discusses a textbook lesson concerned with garage sales, and questions
whether this is useful to learners in countries where people do not sell their used possessions
in this way. Language teachers also need to be aware that English as an international lan-
guage, by its very definition, does not belong to a single culture, so it is difficult to decide
which cultures should be taught (McKay 2000). This does not mean that culture is not an
important part of language learning but that the teaching of it requires sensitivity and respect.
```

**384 Dorothy Chun and Jan Frodesen**

### CHAPTER SUMMARY

```
Anyone who has ever tried to learn a language has probably experienced the excitement
of being able to understand and communicate with speakers of that language. Most of us
have also experienced the difficulties and frustrations of not being as fluent or proficient
in an L2 as we are in our native language. The field of second language acquisition is
relatively new (only about a half-century old) and is still grappling with the questions
of how learners create a new language system (their interlanguage) with only limited
exposure to an L2, what parts of an L2 are learned, and what is not learned or is more
difficult to learn. Since language is a complex human phenomenon, with physical,
cognitive, and sociocultural dimensions, understanding language learning will require
us to take all of these dimensions into account. As we have seen, the main approaches to
the study of SLA have been influenced by linguistics, psychology, and most recently, by
sociocultural theory, but the process of SLA is complex and there are still no definitive
answers as to why most people do not master other languages as well as their first.
Nevertheless, linguistic research continues to deepen our understanding of the processes
of first and second language acquisition, and the field of applied linguistics continues to
act upon this growing knowledge base in order to develop approaches and materials that
will facilitate SLA.

### EXERCISES

**1.** With one or more classmates, take turns interviewing each other about your language-learning experiences
    using the questions raised in the Stop and Reflect boxes of this chapter, either in class or on a class website.
    If one of you has not studied another language, you could consider the questions in regard to someone
    you know, such as a relative or friend.
**2.** Think of the most effective foreign language teacher you have ever had.
    **i.** What were the most effective things the teacher did to help you learn?
    **ii.** What were the most important/effective things in the textbook or course materials?
    **iii.** What did _you_ have to do in order to learn the language?
**3.** Identify an L2 speaker of a language that you speak well. Record the speaker either talking in a
    conversation or narrating a brief story. Transcribe the person’s speech in IPA, then describe any phonetic
    differences that mark the speech as non-native, including reference to vowels, consonants, melody,
    rhythm, and stress.
**4.** Search the internet for a list of the 2,000 most common words in one of the languages that you have
    studied or learned. About how many of these words do you know? How proficient do you feel in this
    language? Do you feel that your proficiency can essentially be measured by the number of vocabulary
    words that you know, or are other factors involved?
**5.** In the transcript below, an adolescent learner of English is telling a story to a listener, using the book _A Boy,_
    _a Dog, a Frog and a Friend_ , which has illustrations but no words. What grammatical errors can you identify?
    If you were an ESL tutor for this learner, what types of things might you focus on for a language lesson?
       _One day a little boy went to the lake and he was fishing. Suddenly he felt something fall into the lake and_
       _he was pulled into the lake and he falled into water. And his dog and his friend frog also jumped into the_
       _lake. And then he found ... other side of the lake he met a big turtle. And they followed the turtle. His_
       _friend, the dog? I don’t know if that’s the thing. He was talking to the turtle and they ... the turtle was so_
       _... the turtle and the dog fought each other and turtle bite dog’s foot. The turtle couldn’t open mouth, open_
       _his mouth and boy tried to help dog. But, turtle never open his mouth so they decided to take the turtle_
       _with his dog. And the boy and dog and frog, and they went back the other side of the lake. And the turtle_
       _was disappears. The turtle was in the water but again the turtle bite bites the dog’s tail and the dog falled_
       _fall into the water again._
**6.** A special area of pragmatics research, called L2 developmental pragmatics, considers how learners develop
    the ability to respond in an L2 to social situations such as ones involving making requests, complaints, and
    apologies. One study (Beebe and Waring 2005) asked English adult learners how they would respond to
    insults in several situations. The researchers asked their subjects to write down what they “thought they
    would say” using actual words, not descriptions, in response to rudeness. In one situation, “the bookstore
    situation,” the customer is told by a rude clerk, _If you want to browse, go to the library_. The following are
    responses that two subjects gave. Which do you think was stated by the lower proficiency learner and
    which by the higher proficiency learner? Why? How would you characterize these very different responses?
    Could factors other than proficiency level explain the difference?
    Response A: _Of course I have the right to have a look before I buy it. But now I changed_
       _my mind. I am not going to buy anything from your store._
    Response B: _I see. I am going to the library._
**7.** Think of the L2 you have learned most recently. Do you mentally translate word for word from your L1
    into your L2 before speaking or writing? Do you find it easier to learn “chunks” of language or to learn
    grammar rules so that you can construct your own sentences? Look at your textbook to see how much of
    the vocabulary is taught in “chunks” or “collocations” and how much is taught in lists. How are vocabulary
    lists organized – by part of speech, by topic, or otherwise? Is this organization helpful for your learning
    style, or would a different strategy be better?
**8.** Here are several more excerpts from language-learning histories written by college students. Discuss each
    in terms of concepts or principles you learned about in this chapter, such as the importance of learning
    contexts (e.g., classroom versus “real-world” settings), the distinction between learning and acquisition,
    negotiated meaning, or other concepts you think are relevant. How do these experiences compare with
    any you have had?

Excerpt 1 (Learner of Spanish, native speaker of English)
[N]othing helped me as much with my fluency as when my friend and I vacationed in Chile last year. The
country has a low English-speaking population and my companion spoke no Spanish, so I was responsible
for reading the signs and menus, and speaking with people for directions. Just walking through the airport
gave me opportunies to interact with native speakers in ways I never had before – finding baggage claim,
renting a car, and finding the hostel. Even though I had not spoken Spanish regularly in almost two years,
after only a few days in Chile, I began to notice that I was thinking directly in Spanish and was no longer
relying on English as my crutch.
Excerpt 2 (Learner of Swedish, native speaker of English)
When I studied abroad in Sweden for four months, I was given an amazing opportunity to learn a lan-
guage in its native country ... My hallmates ... encouraged my Swedish and taught me slang terms and
other necessary vocabulary, but the language that comes most naturally and comfortably to me now is
what I used in daily life when I was alone or trying out my Swedish on unsuspecting clerks.
Excerpt 3 (Learner of English, native speaker of Arabic)
A few months after I graduated from high school I had the opportunity of a lifetime ... I was issued a visa
to come to the USA ... my best friends at the time were English dictionary and grammar books; I have to
say they didn’t help me get that far away. I needed the type of language that would help me survive and get
things done in the real world. A few weeks later I got a job as a cook in a fancy restaurant. I had to improve
my listening comprehension to properly take orders from waiters, and to improve my reading speed to go
quickly through the cook book. Basically, I had no time to write everything I hear, and definitely no time to

       _Ever since I first came to the US my English has been a problem. Even though I might seem to manipulate_
       _it very well while writing it; while talking it is when the main problem appears. Every time I open my_
       _mouth to say something, I just get stuck, and, therefore, I just try to make my ideas as short as I can. This_
       _problem prevents me from saying my entire ideas, or even from talking. For example, while being in a_
       _classroom, I just feel very uncomfortable to ask the teacher something that I did not understand for one or_
       _another reason. The knowing that my pronunciation is not very good discourages me. To think that I have_
       _to talk in front of other 200 persons, probably committing grammar and pronunciation mistakes makes_
       _me feel very small, kind of scared. However, I know that I can do it. After all, I have been in the US living_
       _by my own since last year. Lately, I have been interacting with my teachers more and more, even with my_
       _classmates. Nowadays, I feel that my English still needs A LOT of work (emphasis on the capital letters),_
       _but it is good enough to survive without being put apart from the society._
**10.** If you have studied a second language, what is something you’ve learned about the communicative
    norms of that language (what to say or not to say) that is related to pragmatics/social context (rather than
    grammar)? [If you have never studied a second language, give an example about English communicative
    norms in conversational interaction.]
    **i.** Did you learn about that aspect of L2 pragmatics from a classroom or from interacting with a native

**LANGUAGE PROFILES**



**LANGUAGE PROFILE 1**

Kabardian

1.1 **Introduction**

```
In this language profile, we will apply what we have learned in Chapters 2 and 3 on pho-
netics and phonology in order to examine the phonology of Kabardian, an endangered
Northwest Caucasian language spoken predominantly in the Kabardino-Balkar republic in
the Caucasus mountain region of southern Russia and in Turkey (see Figure LP1.1). We will
focus here on a variety of Kabardian spoken in Turkey; the second author of this profile
grew up speaking the language there.
According to Ethnologue (20th edn., online version), there are approximately 516,000
ethnic Kabardians; it is unknown how many are speakers. About one-third reside in Turkey
following a mass exodus from Russia that occurred after a long period of war in the nine-
teenth century. Most of the remaining speakers still live in Russia, though smaller com-
munities are found in other countries, such as Syria, Lebanon, Georgia, Germany, and
the United States. While there is still a large Kabardian-speaking community in Russia,
the survival of Kabardian outside of Russia is very uncertain. In Turkey, which is home
to over 200,000 ethnic Kabardians, there is no formal instruction in Kabardian available
to students, and the number of people speaking Kabardian at home has steadily declined
due to several factors. These include intermarriage with non-Kabardians and movement
of speakers into large cities where Kabardian is not perceived as a socioeconomically via-
ble language. Turkish laws that actively discouraged the use of minority languages (e.g.,
prohibitions against the publication of materials in languages other than Turkish, a ban
on non-Turkish surnames, and laws against the use of languages other than Turkish in
schools) have only recently been liberalized. Knowledge of Kabardian is unusual in urban
areas, and the prolonged period of decreased social value placed on Kabardian has led
many Kabardian-speaking couples to speak only Turkish to their children. Most Kabardians
in Turkey speak Turkish as a first language.
Kabardian belongs to the Circassian branch of the Northwest branch of the Caucasian
language family. The Circassian branch also includes three other languages: Ubykh, a highly
endangered language of Turkey, and the two closely related varieties of Abkhaz and Abaza.
The Circassian languages are commonly divided into two branches: East Circassian, includ-
ing Kabardian and the closely related Besleney, and West Circassian, including Adyghe and
```

its associated dialects. A family tree depicting the rela-
tionships between Northwest Caucasian languages is
given in Figure LP1.2.
In this language profile we explore the phonolog-
ical system of the variety of Kabardian spoken in
Turkey. By employing the methodology introduced in
Chapter 3, we will discover which sounds are separate
phonemes and which are allophones of the same pho-
neme. We will begin the discussion with the conso-
nants, and then move on to the vowels. In addition,
we will briefly examine syllable structure and stress in
Kabardian.
```
1.2 **Consonants**

1.2.1 Stops

```
Kabardian has aspirated and unaspirated voiceless stops, just as English and Hupa do. Recall
from our discussion of English that aspirated and unaspirated stops are in complementary
distribution, with the aspirated allophone occurring word-initially in words like pin and
```
### SIDEBAR LP1.1

```
Language Profile materials on the student
resources website for How Languages Work
are fun and varied; they are designed to help
students explore the people and culture of
the highlighted groups, in addition to the
languages themselves. The online resources for
the Kabardian Language Profile include sound
files for all of the examples, a sample of some
Kabardian music, and a PowerPoint with cultural
information about the Circassians, the broader
group to which the Kabardians belong.

tab and the unaspirated allophone occurring after [s] in words
like spin and stab. In Hupa, on the other hand, we discovered
minimal pairs differentiated solely on the basis of whether
a stop was aspirated or not and thus concluded that aspiration
is a phonemic, or contrastive, property of stops in Hupa. The
relationship among alveolar stops in these languages was repre-
sented as in Figure LP1.3.
```

of aspirated and unaspirated stops in
English and Hupa.

[tʰanɐ] ‘young bull’
[tanɐ] ‘silk’
As these words show, Kabardian has minimal and near-minimal pairs that are differentiated
only on the basis of aspiration. For example, the pair [pɐ] ‘many’ and [pހɐ] ‘nose’ differ
solely in whether the initial stop is aspirated or not. Likewise, the pair [tanɐ] ‘silk’ and [tހanɐ]
‘young bull’ are distinguished by the aspiration, or lack thereof, on the initial consonant.
```
```
Let’s now ask whether aspirated and unaspirated stops are separate phonemes in
Kabardian, as in Hupa, or whether they are merely allophones, as in English. To tackle this
question, consider the Kabardian words in (1).
```

**392 Matthew Gordon and Ayla Applebaum**

```
As it turns out, there are two other series of stops in Kabardian.
One of these is the ejective series and the other is the voiced
series. Ejective stops are created by closing the glottis and com-
pressing the air behind the stop’s closure position. When the
stop is released, it makes a characteristic popping sound. Voiced
stops, which are familiar from English, contrast with voiceless
stops in pairs such as buy and pie or rankle and wrangle. Ejective
stops are one type of glottalization , the production of a glot-
tal constriction in conjunction with one or more non-glottal
segments.
Whenever there are four series of stops, we need to deter-
mine if they are all phonemic, or if the members of one
series are allophones of another series. Let’s investigate
whether ejective stops and voiced stops in Kabardian are sepa-
rate phonemes, allophones of each other, or allophones of the
voiceless unaspirated and voiceless aspirated stops. The data
in (2) will help determine the phonemic status of ejective and
voiced stops in Kabardian.
```

identical to the vowel found in

There are several minimal and near-minimal triplets in (2), revealing a three-way contrast
in stops at both the bilabial and the alveolar places of articulation. In word-initial position,
the minimal triplet [p’ɐ] ‘bed,’ [pɐ] ‘many,’ and [pހɐ] ‘nose’ shows that ejectives, voiceless
unaspirated, and voiceless aspirated stops are contrastive at the bilabial place of articula-
tion. Similarly, the near-minimal triplet [tހənݕ] ‘easy, comfortable,’ [t’ə] ‘ram,’ and [tədɐ]
‘very’ shows the same three-way contrast for alveolars.

[pʰ][pʰɐ] ‘nose’ [tʰ] [tʰənʃ] ‘easy, comfortable’
In word-medial position, there is also a three-way contrast at both places of articulation.
However, the nature of the contrast differs somewhat from the contrast in word-initial posi-
tion. In medial position, the contrast is between ejectives, aspirated stops, and voiced stops,
as in the triplet [sabܣ] ‘dust,’ [napހܣ] ‘face,’ and [jap’ܣ] ‘their bed.’
```
```
(4) Kabardian three-way contrast in word-medial position
```
```
[p’] [jap’ɐ] ‘their bed’
[b] [sabɐ] ‘dust’
[pʰ] [napʰɐ] ‘face’
Notice that, even though both voiced stops and voiceless unaspirated stops occur in
Kabardian, there is no contrast between voiced and voiceless unaspirated stops in either
initial or medial position. Voiceless unaspirated stops occur word-initially and voiced ones
are found word-medially.
In fact, there is an alternation in the realization of one of the stops, depending on its
position in the word. The first sound in the word [tɐ] ‘nut, seed’ is a voiceless unaspirated
stop, whereas the same sound surfaces as a voiced stop when a prefix is added to form the
word [na-dɐ] ‘hollow, lacking a seed.’ On the basis of this active alternation and the overall
distribution of the two types of stops, we can conclude that voiceless unaspirated stops and
voiced stops are in complementary distribution and are therefore allophones of the
same phoneme. This phoneme contrasts with ejectives and voiceless aspirated stops, which
each occur both word-initially and word-medially. The relationship between phonemes
and allophones for the four types of bilabial stops in Kabardian can be represented as in
Figure LP1.4 (analogous patterns are found for the alveolars).
Both voiceless aspirated stops and ejectives have a single allophone each, whereas the
voiceless unaspirated stop has two allophones: a voiceless unaspirated one in initial posi-
tion and a voiced one in medial position.
So far we have focused on only two places of articulation,
bilabial and alveolar. Kabardian also has stops at other places of
articulation. Two of these, velar stops and the glottal stop, are
familiar from our discussion of English. In addition, Kabardian
has uvular stops, which are produced by raising the back of the
tongue up to touch the uvula.

and Tsez (LP7).
```

**394 Matthew Gordon and Ayla Applebaum**

```
Kabardian allows for further modifications to its stops in the form of secondary artic-
ulations , which involve an additional articulatory gesture overlapping with the primary
stop constriction. The velar, uvular, and glottal stops have secondary articulations with lip
rounding, as described in Textbox LP1.1.
```
### STOP AND REFLECT LP1.1 LEARN TO PRODUCE UVULAR CONSONANTS

```
Try producing uvular consonants yourself. Start by articulating the syllable [ka] with a velar stop. Then retract
your tongue for the consonant, making contact with the roof of the mouth as far back as you can. That will
allow you to produce the syllable [qa], with a voiceless uvular stop in initial position. Say the two syllables
multiple times in rapid succession: [ka qa ka qa ka qa]. Then do the same with the voiced sequence: [ga Ga
ga Ga ga Ga]. (The small cap [G] is the symbol for a voiced uvular stop.) With repetition, you will begin to
perceive the aural difference between the sounds.
Try doing the same exercise using the vowel [i]. You will find it is more difficult because of the very different
tongue positions required for the consonant and vowel in the sequence. You may also observe that the vowel
takes on different acoustic qualities as well.
```
### TEXTBOX LP1.1 SECONDARY LIP ROUNDING

```
The closest English equivalent to stops with secondary
lip rounding in Kabardian are clusters like [kw] in
words like quick and quiet. These English clusters differ
from the Kabardian rounded stops, however, in their
```
```
degree of articulatory overlap between the stop and the
rounding gestures. In English, the stop and the rounding
are produced more or less in sequence, whereas in
Kabardian, they are almost completely overlapped.
```
```
The other type of secondary articulation in Kabardian is palatalization, which can accom-
pany velar stops. Palatalization involves raising the sides of the tongue simultaneously with
the stop closure. Auditorily, palatalization sounds like a stop plus a palatal glide, as in the
casual pronunciation of the name Keanu , where the combination of the initial [k] and the
first vowel sound almost like the sequence [kj].
In addition to stops, Kabardian also has a series of affricates, occurring at the alveolar
place of articulation; these affricates sound similar to clusters of an alveolar stop plus an
alveolar fricative in English words such as cats and kids. The voiceless affricate also occurs as
aspirated [tsހ] and as an ejective [ts’].
The words in (5) illustrate the stop and affricate phonemes of Kabardian. It may be noted
that none of the places of articulation behind the alveolar place of articulation makes a three-
way contrast between voiceless unaspirated, voiceless aspirated, and ejective stops. In addition,
Textbox LP1.2 explains some of the transcription conventions used for secondary articulations.
```
### TEXTBOX LP1.2 TRANSCRIPTION OF SECONDARY ARTICULATIONS

```
Secondary articulations, such as labialization,
glottalization, and palatalization, are seen as additional
articulations overlapped with the primary consonant.
In order to indicate their secondary status, they are
written as superscripts:
```
```
[ ʷ ] labialization
```
```
[’] glottalization
```
```
[j] palatalization

1.2.2 Fricatives
Kabardian also has a large number of fricative phonemes: eighteen in total. While many of
these are found in English, including [f, v, s, z, ݕ, ݤ, h], others are not. Kabardian has a voiceless
palatal fricative [ç], voiced and voiceless velar and uvular fricatives
(some of which are accompanied by lip rounding), as well as a voice-
less pharyngeal fricative [ħ] and a lateral fricative [ɬ].
First, let’s look at the places of articulation found in the Kabardian
fricative inventory. We are already familiar with velars and uvulars
from our discussion of stops, but we have not yet encountered pala-
tal fricatives, pharyngeal consonants, or lateral fricatives. The voice-
less palatal fricative [ç] has an equivalent English sound in the initial
consonant in some pronunciations of the words human and hue.
Pharyngeal fricatives are produced by retracting the root of the tongue
toward the back of the throat to create a constriction, which gives the
auditory impression of a noisy [h] sound. We are already familiar with lateral approximants,
such as [l], from our discussion of English. Lateral fricatives are produced by raising the mid-
dle of the tongue slightly while maintaining the closure with the tip of the tongue. The result
will be a noisy fricative, which can be either voiced or not. The voiceless lateral fricative [ܾ]
of Kabardian sounds quite similar to the allophone of [l] found after the aspirated stop in
English words like clay and plea , where the aspiration noise overlaps with the [l].
Another interesting type of fricative in Kabardian is the ejective fricative. Kabardian has
three: [f’, ݕ’, ܾ’]. These are quite rare in the languages of the world. In a cross-linguistic survey
of phoneme inventories, Maddieson (1984) reports that ejective fricatives occur in only 10
out of 317 languages. Ejective fricatives are produced much like their stop counterparts, by

```

**396 Matthew Gordon and Ayla Applebaum**

```
compressing air in a chamber between the glottis and the oral constriction. In the case of
fricatives, the oral constriction is not complete but is merely tight enough to produce noise.
This requires a delicate balancing act, since the fricative opening allows the escape of some
of the air that is necessary to create the pressure increase for the ejective’s characteristic
release burst.

1.2.3 Sonorants

```
The remaining Kabardian consonant phonemes are also found in English. Kabardian has
two nasals [m, n], a palatal approximant [j], a labial-velar approximant [w], and a lateral
approximant [l]. It also has a tap [ݐ], which does not occur word-initially and is often real-
ized with some noise, particularly when devoiced in final position. The tap is grouped here
with the sonorants because in Kabardian it shares phonological behavior with the other
sonorants, suggesting that it is part of the sonorant natural class in this language. Words
exemplifying [m, n, j, l, ݐ] appear in (7).

in Turkey. There are a total of forty-five consonants. This far exceeds the average number of
consonants found in the world’s languages, which is twenty-one according to Maddieson’s
survey of 317 languages. The Kabardian inventory also dwarfs the twenty-five consonants
found in American English.

In the first six words, there are two near-minimal triplets, demonstrating the phonemic
status of the three vowels [a, ɐ, ə]. In the remaining forms, four additional vowel qualities [i,
e, o, u] emerge. These vowels, however, are limited in
the contexts in which they occur. The two back rounded
vowels [o, u] occur before rounded consonants, either
the labial-velar glide [w] or fricatives associated with a
secondary rounding articulation. The two front vowels
[i, e], on the other hand, only occur before the palatal
glide [j] (see Sidebar LP1.9). This distribution suggests
that [o, u, i, e] are allophones of other phonemes. The
question then becomes which pairs of vowels belong
together as allophones of the same phoneme.
To answer this question, we first observe that the low vowel [a] occurs in the widest range
of environments: before [j], before rounded consonants, as well as in the same environments
in which [ɐ] and [ə] also occur. We can thus conclude that [a] has no other allophones.
This leaves the six vowels [i, e, u, o, ɐ, ə], which can be grouped into three groups of two,
according to the contexts in which they occur. The first two occur only before [j], the next
two occur only before rounded consonants, and the last two occur in contexts other than
those in which the first four vowels occur, that is, they occur elsewhere. The complica-
tion in determining allophonic relationships here lies in the fact that there are two vowels
occurring in each of the three contexts, as (9) shows.
```
### SIDEBAR LP1.9

```
It should be noted that both of the processes
differentiating the vowel pairs are phonetically
natural instances of articulatory overlap
between adjacent sounds. Lip rounding from a
following rounded consonant spreads leftward
onto the preceding vowel, and the high front
tongue body position associated with /j/
triggers fronting of the preceding vowel.
```
**(9)** Before /j/ Before rounded consonants Elsewhere
iu ə
eo ɐ
This means that [ə] is in complementary distribution with not only both [u] and [i] but also
[o] and [e] (as [ə] never occurs before /j/ or rounded consonants). Likewise, [ɐ] is in comple-
mentary distribution with not only [o] and [e] but also [u] and [i]. The question is which


**399 Language Profile 1 Kabardian**

```
vowels stem from the same phoneme and which ones are linked to a different phoneme. Are
[u] and [i], or [e] and [o], allophones of [ə]? Are [u] and [i], or [e] and [o], allophones of [ɐ]?
In fact, there are other possible groupings of vowels that maintain the complementary
distributions. For example, [u] and [e] could be allophones of [ə], and [o] and [i] could be
allophones of [ɐ]. Alternatively, [i] and [o] could be allophones of [ə], and [u] and [e] could
be allophones of [ɐ]. To determine the correct pairings, we need to apply the notion of
phonetic similarity that must be true of allophones. In order to be allophones, not only
must two or more sounds be in complementary distribution, they also must be phonetically
similar to each other.
To assess phonetic similarity in the case of Kabardian vowels, it is useful to draw a chart
depicting the location of vowels in the Kabardian vowel space. This chart is given in (10).
```
**(10)** Front Central Back
High iu
Mid e ə o
Mid-low ɐ
Low a
We have determined that [i] and [u] are allophones of one of the central vowels, and
that [e] and [o] are allophones of another. Initially, one might be tempted to group [a]
with [ə] and [o], since they are all mid vowels. However, this would force us to assume
that the mid-low vowel /ɐ/ has the phonetically much higher vowel allophones of [i] and
[u], which would violate the requirement that allophones be phonetically similar to each
other. Instead, we should group the higher of the vowel pairs, [i] and [u], with the high-
est of the mid vowels, [ə], as this is phonetically more similar to the high vowels than is
[ɐ]. Similarly, the front and the back rounded vowels in Kabardian that are most similar
phonetically to [ɐ] are [e] and [o], as these are the lower of the two pairs, and [ɐ] is lower
than [ə].
We can thus conclude that [ɐ], [e], and [o] are allophones of the same phoneme, whose
base form is /ɐ/. This sound is the base phoneme, since it occurs in a wider range of contexts
than the other two allophones. This leaves /i/ and /u/ as allophones of the basic phoneme
[a], which may be treated as basic due to its wider distribution compared to the other two
variants. The resulting relationship between phonemes and allophones for Kabardian vow-
els is shown in Figure LP1.5.
Much more could be said about Kabardian vowels. For example, there are other vowel
allophones occurring in various consonantal contexts beyond those we have considered
here. Furthermore, the number of vowel phonemes in Kabardian has been a subject of
intense debate among phonologists for over fifty years. Analyses of the vowel system have
ranged from positing three underlying vowel phonemes, as in the account adopted here

```
based on traditional Russian sources, to assuming only two vowel phonemes, or even a
single vowel.
```
1.4 **Syllable Structure**

```
Kabardian allows a variety of syllable structures ranging from simple to complex. (For a
review of terminology related to syllable structure, see Textbox LP1.3.) The smallest possible
syllable consists of a single vowel as in the first syllable of the word a.n ɐ ‘mother.’ Closed
syllables are quite common, e.g., p ɐ n ‘coffin’ and ѻ’ ə b ‘back.’ Consonant clusters are also
widely attested, both in syllable onset and in syllable coda position, e.g., tȤҭ ɐ ‘butter,’ ps ə
‘water,’ p ʃ tҦ ə ‘boil’ (milk), f ə zijpѤ’ ‘five women,’ and m ə Ѥkҭ ‘property.’
```
### TEXTBOX LP1.3 SYLLABLE TERMINOLOGY

```
The syllable was introduced in Section 2.7.1 The core terminology is reviewed below.
```
```
Onset: the consonant(s) preceding the vowel
Coda: the consonant(s) following the vowel
Rhyme: the vowel and coda together, opposed to the onset
Closed syllable: syllable with a coda (“closed off” by one or more consonants)
Open syllable: syllable without a coda
```
1.4.1 Stress

```
Let’s now turn to the positioning of stress in Kabardian words. Recall from Chapter 2 on
phonetics that there are pairs of words in English that are distinguished only on the basis
of where stress falls. For example, the noun import has stress on the first syllable, whereas
the verb import has stress on the second syllable. The words in (11) illustrate the location of
stress in several Kabardian words. Syllable boundaries are indicated using the IPA symbol for
syllable breaks [.] to facilitate examination of the patterns.
```
Sound
files for
(11)

**(11)** [ˈpʰa.sɐ] ‘early’
[ˈsa.bɐ] ‘dust’
[ˈmə.ʃɐ] ‘bear’
[ʔɐ.ˈda.q’ɐ] ‘rooster’
[χɐɾ.^1 zə.nɐ] ‘good’
[mə.ʔɐ.ˈɾə.sɐ] ‘apple’
There are no minimal stress pairs in the Kabardian data in (11). However, when examin-
ing stress in a language, it is useful to look not only for minimal stress pairs but also for con-
sistent patterns in the location of stress. For example, in many languages, such as Finnish or
Czech, stress falls on the initial syllable of words. In other languages, such as Turkish, stress
falls on the final syllable. In the Kabardian data in (11), stress does not consistently fall on


**401 Language Profile 1 Kabardian**

```
either the initial syllable or the final syllable. However, we can still make a generalization
about the words: stress falls on the second-to-last syllable. The second-to-last syllable is also
known as the penultimate syllable (see Textbox LP1.4). Penultimate stress is quite com-
mon in languages of the world. For example, it is found in Polish, Mohawk, and Albanian.
```
### TEXTBOX LP1.4 SYLLABLE TERMINOLOGY FOR STRESS PATTERNS

```
When discussing stress across different languages,
the syllables at the beginning of the word are simply
called the first, second, and third syllable. When
referring to syllables near the end of the word, we
use the terms ultimate syllable (for the last syllable
```
```
in the word, or the ultima), penultimate syllable
(for the second-to-last syllable in the word, or the
penult), and antepenultimate syllable (for the
syllable preceding the penult, sometimes called the
antepenult).
```
```
Now let’s look at several more Kabardian words in (12) to see if they conform to the
penultimate stress pattern.
```
```
Sound
files for
(12)
```
```
(12) [sɐ.ˈbən] ‘soap’
[səj.ˈʃ’əb] ‘my back’
[sa.ˈbij] ‘baby’
[na.ˈnuw] ‘kid’
The words in (12) all have final (or ultimate) stress, unlike those in (11), which had penul-
timate stress. At this point, there are two different ways we could proceed: we could give
up hope of finding any consistent generalization about the location of stress and merely
say that each word must be memorized as having either final or penultimate stress; or alter-
natively, we could compare the two groups of words to see if there is any difference in the
shape of the words that might account for their different stress patterns. You can do this
yourself; see Stop and Reflect LP1.3.
```
### STOP AND REFLECT LP1.3 CAN YOU FIND THE STRESS PATTERN?

```
Before reading further, take the time to compare the words in (11) and (12) yourself. Can you identify what
phonological properties of the words determine whether the stress is ultimate or penultimate?
```
```
Your exploration should have revealed that there is such a difference. All of the words in
(12), which have final stress, end in a consonant, whereas those in (11), which have penul-
timate stress, end in a vowel. We can thus see that stress-assignment depends upon syllable
structure.
```
### TEXTBOX LP1.5 SYLLABLE WEIGHT

```
Syllable weight is a reflection of the complexity
and “bulk” of syllables. Heavy syllables typically
have either a long vowel, a diphthong, or
consonants in a coda, depending on the criteria
```
```
in a particular language. Light syllables typically
end in a short vowel. Interestingly, complexity in
onset consonants tends not to affect the weight of
syllables.
```

**402 Matthew Gordon and Ayla Applebaum**

```
This is an instance of weight-sensitive stress , since the weight or complexity of sylla-
bles influences the stress pattern. Textbox LP1.5 gives a brief explanation of syllable weight.
In Kabardian, final syllables attract stress if they are complex, or heavy; a syllable-final coda
consonant makes a syllable heavy. If the final syllable is light and contains a vowel without
a coda consonant, stress shifts leftward onto the penultimate syllable. Weight-sensitive
stress systems are common in the languages of the world (see Textbox LP1.6 for another
example). Weight-sensitive stress systems, as well as weight-insensitive stress systems, in
which stress predictably falls on a certain syllable regardless of syllable weight, together
constitute the class of stress patterns with phonologically predictable – as opposed to
phonemic – stress.
```
### TEXTBOX LP1.6 ANOTHER WEIGHT-SENSITIVE STRESS SYSTEM: LATIN

```
Another language that famously has weight-sensitive
stress is Latin. In classical Latin, the penultimate is stressed
only if it is heavy; otherwise, the stress is shifted leftward
to the antepenult (if there is one). Thus the word
```
```
au. ‘ gus.tus ‘August,’ has stress on the penult, which
is a heavy syllable due to the final /s/. This can be
compared with ‘ ca.pi.tis ‘head (genitive singular),’
where the penult is light and stress is on the antepenult.

### CHAPTER SUMMARY

```
In this chapter we have surveyed certain basic features of the Kabardian phonological
system, including the consonant and vowel phonemes, allophones of these phonemes,
syllable structure, and stress. Kabardian phonology is of typological interest for a
variety of reasons, including its small vowel and large consonant inventories, which
include a twelve-way contrast among voiceless fricatives, and contrasts of ejective
and non-ejective fricatives at three places of articulation. There are many additional
fascinating aspects of Kabardian phonology – not to mention Kabardian morphology
and syntax – that we have left untouched. Many published sources on Kabardian are
written in Russian; for more information on Kabardian, the interested reader is referred
to the Suggestions for Further Reading, which contains references written in English.

**LANGUAGE PROFILE 2**

Goemai

2.1 **Introduction**

```
Goemai (pronounced /gəҒmâi/) is a West Chadic language of Nigeria. As such, it is a mem-
ber of the large Afroasiatic language family and thus distantly related to Semitic languages,
such as Arabic and Hebrew. Within Afroasiatic, Goemai belongs to the Chadic branch,
more specifically, to the Southern Angas-Goemai group within the West Chadic sub-
branch. Figure LP2.1 summarizes the genealogical position of Goemai within Afroasiatic.
The language is spoken by approximately 150,000 speakers in the lowlands of Central
Nigeria, just south of the Jos Plateau and north of the River Benue. The map in Figure LP2.2
gives an indication of the geographical location of the Goemai, showing the three Goemai
dialect areas, Duut (including East Ankwe), Dorok, and Kwo.
Over the last century, another Chadic language, Hausa, has emerged as a major language
in this area. The use of Hausa is slowly replacing the use of many of the minor languages
in the area, including Goemai. Today, most Goemai use Hausa in formal settings (e.g., in
contexts involving administration, religion, or education) and when interacting with their
many non-Goemai neighbors. Members of the younger generation tend to speak Hausa
even to each other; and many children grow up with Hausa as their first, and often only,
language.
```
2.2 **Basic Typological Overview**

```
Goemai has a fairly complex phonology. One of the most striking features is a three-
way distinction between voiceless aspirated, voiceless non-aspirated, and voiced stops
and fricatives. It also has a series of implosive stops at the labial and alveolar places of
articulation (see Textbox LP2.1). The language contrasts long and short vowels, and four
tones (high, low, falling, rising). Table LP2.1 illustrates some (near-) minimal pairs: (1)
exemplifies alveolar stops and implosives, (2) vowel length contrasts, and (3) high and
low tones.

The Goemai people have a way of writing their language
called a practical orthography , which will be used here.
Note that p, t, k, f, s , and sh indicate aspirated obstruents, p’,
t’, k’, f’, s’ , and sh ’ indicate non-aspirated obstruents and b’ and
d’ indicate the two implosives. For the vowels, oe indicates [ə],
u indicates [ݛ], and o indicates [ɔ]. Double letters indicate long
vowels, and tones are placed over vowels by means of accents,
e.g., é indicates a high tone, è a low tone, ê a falling tone, and
Č a rising tone.
Goemai has three open word classes, that is, word classes that
easily incorporate new members: nouns, verbs, and adverbs.
Notice that Goemai does not have any simple lexical adjectives.
While Goemai can use derivational morphology to turn verbs
and adverbs into adjectival modifiers, there is no word class of
underived adjectives.
```
### SIDEBAR LP2.1

```
The online resources for this
language profile include sound files
for all examples, photos of Goemai
speakers who serve as consultants
to the author, a PowerPoint with

conversational discourse about a
Goemai proverb, with audio files.
```
### SIDEBAR LP2.2

```
For more on tones and tone
languages, see the Manange
Language Profile, Textbox LP3.4.
```
### TEXTBOX LP2.2 IDEOPHONES

```
Goemai has about eighty ideophones , words that
convey vivid images of properties (such as color
or age), spatial orientations (such as posture or
disposition), or bodily processes (such as belching
or yawning). Morphologically, the ideophones
are often characterized through reduplication ,
```
```
e.g., sòesák ‘snow white’ or wùwák ‘bright red.’
Ideophones have found their way into other word
classes, too. For example, many nouns that denote
birds reflect the characteristic sound of the bird,
e.g., gòekúk ‘owl, cuckoo,’ kòerè ‘crow,’ or t’íngìlíít
‘hornbill.’
```
### TEXTBOX LP2.1 IMPLOSIVE STOPS

```
Implosive stops are articulated by simultaneously
creating the stop in the supralaryngeal cavity and
tightly closing the vocal folds. The glottis is then
lowered, expanding the pharynx and creating a
vacuum, so that when the supralaryngeal closure
is released the air rushes inwards, giving the stop a
```
```
characteristic sound. Implosives are found in a number
of languages, including some regional dialects of
American English. Implosives are transcribed in the IPA
with a hook at the top of the symbol, i.e., [ɓ, ɗ, ɠ]. In
the Goemai practical orthography, the two implosives
are written with a following apostrophe: b’, d’.
```

**408 Birgit Hellwig**

```
Goemai also has closed word classes, such as pronouns, vari-
ous noun-phrase modifiers, ideophones, prepositions, particles,
and conjunctions (see Textbox LP2.2). In most cases, a word
occurs in one word class only. Thus, it is uncommon for a word
to occur interchangeably as a noun and as a verb, as in English
The table is big and He tabled the motion. Furthermore, there are only a few Goemai deriva-
tional morphemes that change the lexical class of words.
As we will see in more detail below, nouns always function as heads of noun phrases and
are usually morphologically unmarked. Although Goemai grammar marks number (singu-
lar, plural) and classifies nouns based on the posture of referents (see Textbox LP2.3), these
categories are – with very few exceptions – not marked on the noun itself.
Verbs in Goemai always function as heads of predicates and are also generally unmarked.
There are only two exceptions to this generalization, as will be shown later: about 10 per-
cent of the verbal lexicon distinguishes number; and some subject pronouns can be marked
on the verb. Other categories, such as tense or negation, are usually not marked on the verb
either but are expressed through particles.
```
### SIDEBAR LP2.3

```
Open versus closed word classes
were introduced in Section 5.2.
```
### TEXTBOX LP2.3 POSTURAL CLASSES

```
Goemai distinguishes four postural classes (hanging/
moving, sitting, standing, and lying) plus one residual
class (for all objects that do not fall into one of the
postural classes). This classification is based on the
typical “posture” of objects. For example, “sitting”
objects are all objects that are typically located on
```
```
their base and that have a usage space. This includes
all types of containers (cups, pots, bottles, baskets,
etc.), as well as traditional chairs or woven mats that
protect food from flies. This class also includes novel

The brief description above illustrates that Goemai is a predominantly isolating lan-
guage. That is, there is little morphology, and words are usually unmarked and monomor-
phemic (i.e., they consist of a single morpheme only). While there is some nominal and
verbal morphology in Goemai, it plays a lesser role than in other languages. Because of its
largely isolating nature, Goemai grammar relies heavily on syntax. The importance of syn-
tax over morphology can be seen in the structure of its phrases as well as in its grammatical
relations, as explained below.
```
```
2.3 Syntax
Chapter 6 has shown in some detail how languages combine words to form phrases and
sentences. This language profile explores some of these syntactic phenomena: the forma-
tion of noun phrases and ways of expressing grammatical relations.
```
```
2.3.1 Noun Phrases
Goemai is one of many languages that show clear evidence for the existence of noun
phrases. The Goemai noun phrase (NP) consists of an obligatory head noun and optional
modifiers or dependents. These dependents tell us something about the head noun: some
help us to identify the referent (e.g., the demonstratives point to a referent in the physical
environment, and the articles specify whether or not a referent has been mentioned in the
previous discourse), while others offer further descriptive information (e.g., the adjectival
modifiers describe a quality of the referent, such as its color or size). All dependents occur
in a fixed order, with some of them preceding the head noun (i.e., occurring pre-head) and
some following (i.e., occurring post-head). Table LP2.2 provides the template of the Goemai
noun phrase; it summarizes the order of selected pre-head and post-head dependents rel-
ative to the head noun and to each other. Examples (1) to (4) illustrate the depicted order
using data from natural discourse.

Heads and dependents can occur only in the order illustrated in Examples (1) to (4); any
reordering would result in an ungrammatical utterance.
A noun phrase can consist of a head noun only, such as néng ‘cow’ in (5) but can never
consist of a dependent element only. However, a dependent element can be turned into
a head noun by means of the nominalizing prefixes gòe - (SG) or mòe - (PL). For example,
the dependent demonstrative Ĕd’éĔnòe ‘this’ never occurs without a head noun, as in (4).
Its nominalized form, however, does occur as the head of a noun phrase, such as with
gòeĔd’éĔnòe ‘this one’ in (5).

The head of a noun phrase can be either a noun, as in (5), or a pronoun, as in (6).
(6) muép lá kàt [ ní ]NP
and.3PL when/if find 3 SG.OBJ
‘And when they find [him]NP (...).’
With regard to pronominal heads, Goemai displays one very interesting phenomenon.
Cross-linguistically, pronouns tend to replace the entire noun phrase. This is also the most
common pattern in Goemai. However, it is possible for a pronominal head to replace only
the nominal head, and thus co-occur with noun-phrase dependents. Example (7) shows a
pronoun co-occurring with the definite article.
(7) muèp lá k’ààr [ ní=hók ]NP
2 PL when/if instruct 3 SG.OBJ=DEF
‘When they instruct [(the) her]NP.’
Thus, the constituency test of cohesiveness does not apply in Goemai, so the properties
of the noun phrase in Goemai are slightly different from those in English or other lan-
guages where a pronoun must replace all elements of the noun phrase.
An additional argument for the Goemai noun phrase is that
noun-phrase elements always form a contiguous group, that
is, they cannot be separated by other morphemes such as par-
ticles or adverbs. For example, the object noun phrase below
is followed by a particle Ȗì and an adverb Ĕt’ìt ‘well.’ It is not
possible for either of them to occur anywhere within the noun
phrase.

2.3.2 Grammatical Relations

```
Like English, Goemai is a language where grammatical behavior
is shared between the single core argument of an intransitive
verb and the more agentive argument of a transitive verb. Thus
Goemai, like English, has grammatical subjects that are distinct
from objects.
Constituent order is the most obvious piece of evidence for
distinguishing Goemai subjects from objects. Goemai constitu-
ent order is fixed in that subjects always precede the verb, while
objects follow it. Example (11) illustrates the intransitive pat-
tern, with the single core argument preceding the verb. Example
(12) illustrates the transitive pattern, with the more agentive
argument (i.e., the rabbit as opposed to the stone) being placed
before the verb.
```

```

(12)

```
(12) fuán máng p’áng
rabbit take stone
‘The rabbit took a stone.’
```
```
The noun phrase itself is not morphologically marked for its grammatical relation, that is,
Goemai does not have any case marking. Pronouns, however, constitute a partial exception
to this generalization. Goemai has both free and bound pronouns. The free pronouns are
identical for all core arguments (i.e., for subjects and objects). But the bound forms can be
used only for subjects, not for objects. Table LP2.3 lists the two sets of pronouns.
```

The transitive pattern in (12) can
be contrasted with patterns of
argument alignment in Tsez and

Answer to Stop and Reflect LP2.1:
The morphological constituency test
revealed in examples (9) and (10)
is agreement: adjectival modifiers
agree with the head noun. They
have the prefix gòe- when the noun
is singular and the prefix mòe- when
the noun is plural. This indicates that
the adjectival modifier and noun are
grammatically linked; they are part
of a single constituent.

The discussion above has shown that there are three criteria that can be evoked to estab-
lish grammatical relations in Goemai: constituent order, pronominal form, and marking of
arguments on the verb. While these three criteria clearly distinguish subjects from objects,
sometimes core arguments are hard to identify, especially when all core arguments are
```
```

The bound pronouns attach to the verb as clitics. They can
occur with or without any overt noun phrase. Compare (13),
where the clitic pronoun is the only morpheme that references
the subject, with (14) and (15), which include subject noun
phrases. In all cases, it is the subject that is marked on the verb,
regardless of whether the verb is intransitive (as in 14 ), or transi-
tive (as in 13 and 15 ). In contrast, the object argument is never
marked on the verb.

### SIDEBAR LP2.8

```
You might be familiar with subject-
agreement in Romance languages;
e.g., Italian io ball-o ‘I dance,’ tu
ball-i ‘you dance,’ lui ball-a ‘he
dances.’ Bound pronouns are similar,
but not identical. For example,
bound pronouns can be omitted in
Goemai, as illustrated in (16).

### CHAPTER SUMMARY

```
Goemai is a West Chadic language with a number of interesting typological features,
including implosive stops, tone, and ideophones. It is an isolating language with
little morphology and a highly structured syntax. Several arguments were made to
demonstrate that the noun phrase forms a syntactic constituent in Goemai. There is also
evidence for grammatical subjects and objects, including constituent order, pronominal
form, and marking of arguments on the verb.

In (16), the first clause (line 1) introduces two core arguments
(‘some poor person’ and ‘a little bit of porridge’) by means of
lexical noun phrases. In the following clauses, however, they are
not referred to by noun phrases or by pronouns. In line 2 both
the subject and the object of the verb póe ‘give (away)’ have been
omitted, and in line 3 the object of both the verbs láp ‘receive’
and s’óe ‘eat’ is not specified. The practice of omitting noun
phrases and pronominal clitics when it is clear who is doing
what to whom is common in this language and in many others.

**2.** Goemai displays an interesting phenomenon: a subset of its verbs have distinct singular and plural forms.
    Table LP2.4 summarizes those verbs that occur in this exercise.
       Verbs agree in number with one (and only one) of the core arguments. In the case of intransitive clauses,
    the verb unsurprisingly agrees with the subject argument. This pattern is illustrated in Examples (a) and
       (b): plural marking on the verb indicates that the subject argument is plural
       (a), while singular marking on the verb indicates that the subject is singular
       (b). Notice that the subject noun phrase itself is unmarked for number in
       both examples: _gùrùm_ ‘person/people’ is interpreted as plural because of
       the plural verb, and _áás_ ‘dog/dogs’ is interpreted as singular because of the
       singular verb. Alternatively, it is possible for both the noun phrase and the
       verb to be marked for the same number (as in (c) and (d)).

### EXERCISES

**1.** The following examples contain quantifiers (such as _díp_ ‘all’) and numerals (such as _gòemé_ ‘one’ and _vél_

**LANGUAGE PROFILE 3**

Manange

3.1 **Introduction**

```
Manange is a Sino-Tibetan language spoken in Nepal. Sino-Tibetan is a very large language
family with over 360 languages; it is itself split into two “sub-families”: Sinitic, comprising
languages from (mainly) China, and Tibeto-Burman, comprising over 350 languages west
to east from Pakistan, India, Nepal, Tibet, Bhutan, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Thailand, and
China. Manange belongs to the Bodish subgrouping of Tibeto-Burman. This genealogical
profile is given in more detail in Figure LP3.1.
Nepal (The Federal Democratic Republic of Nepal since 2007) is a landlocked country
of approximately 57,000 square miles (similar in size to the US state of Illinois) located in
South Asia, with India bordering the south, east, and west, and Tibet/China to the north.
The official language of Nepal, and also its lingua franca (see
Textbox LP3.1), is Nepali, an Indo-European language. The
capital city of Kathmandu is located in the central part of the
country, at an elevation of about 4,400 feet, while the Manang
District, the traditional home of Manange speakers, is located
to the north and west of Kathmandu. The map in Figure LP3.2
gives a geographic perspective on the location of Manang.

### TEXTBOX LP3.1 LINGUA FRANCA

```
A lingua franca is a language that is spoken within
multilingual communities where people do not speak
each other’s ancestral languages. It usually functions
as a language of commerce in a particular nation or
region where there is extensive multilingualism. In
```
```
Nepal, the lingua franca nationwide is Nepali (also the
official language of Nepal), but in certain regions within
the country, other indigenous languages have lingua
franca status, including some dialects of Tibetan in
western Nepal.

The average elevation of the thirteen Manange-speaking villages is higher than that of
Kathmandu, at around 10,000 feet above sea level, with the highest point in Manang at
17,765 feet. The population of Manang is much sparser than that of the rest of Nepal: under
10,000 people live in a district of 867 square miles (the total population of Nepal is cur-
rently around 30 million, with over 1 million people in the Kathmandu area). As discussed
```

**420 Kristine Hildebrandt**

```
below, these geographic and human aspects have a significant impact on the linguistic
situation in Manang.
The map also shows an important factor in the socioeconomic organization of Manange
speakers: the Annapurna Circuit (roughly approximated via the dashed line). This is a foot-
path of approximately 185 miles in length, which bisects the Manang District as it runs
through central Nepal. Traditionally, the Annapurna Circuit was a route for trading food-
stuffs and other goods between the Manang region and the rest of Nepal, Tibet, and India.
Nowadays the Annapurna Circuit is famous as a trail for backpackers or “trekkers.” As a
result, the nearer to the Circuit a Manange settlement is, the more that settlement’s eco-
nomic practices are tailored toward the tourist economy.
Manange villages located right on the Circuit have houses converted into luxury-style
lodges, some with German-style bakeries and electricity capabilities operated by small
hydro-power generators. There are also numerous small shops selling goods for trekkers.
There is a growing predominance of Nepali bilingualism (and to some extent, English), as
villagers interact with tourists, porters, and trekking guides, or as city Mananges relocate
to Manang to reap the rewards of the trekking industry. The socioeconomic situation for
inhabitants who live farther away from the Circuit is much different: they engage mainly
in yak and goat shepherding, as well as in limited farming, which includes growing buck-
wheat, potatoes, cauliflower, and garlic in the cooler, drier climates, or corn, millet, and
wheat in the warmer southern portions of Manang.

**421 Language Profile 3 Manange**

```
Manange, which has a number of different names (see Textbox LP3.2), is not the only lan-
guage spoken in Manang; it is one of four Bodish languages in the area, including Gurung,
Nar-Phu, and Gyalsumdo, which is a Tibetan variety. In addition to these languages,
Tibetan speakers are also represented in Manang; these speakers are typically migrants who
have relocated to Manang due to the lucrative tourist season and better grazing condi-
tions. Additionally, Thakali people, who inhabit the Mustang District to the northwest of
Manang, regularly travel through Manang with mule trains.

### TEXTBOX LP3.2 LANGUAGE NAMES

```
Many languages have more than one language name.
In other words, languages may have one or more
endonyms or autonyms (language names used by
the locals or group members themselves) and also
one or more exonyms (names used by outsiders, and
not by group members themselves). Manange is a
good example of this: speakers self-report their ethnic
group and language name as Nyeshang, Nyeshangte,
or Nyangmi (these names are their endonyms). Non-
Manange speakers frequently refer to the ethnic group
and its speakers as Manange, Manangi, Managkye,
```
```
Manangba, or Manangbhot (all exonyms). This is
not just true for Manange, but for more commonly
encountered languages like German (endonym:
Deutsch), Dutch (endonym: Nederlands), and Scottish
Gaelic (endonym: A’ Ghàidhlig). Another example of
an endonym/exonym difference within Nepal is that
of Newar (endonym: Nepal Bhasa). Interestingly, the
term “Manange” has been gradually shifting from a
strict exonym to having endonym status, especially for
younger speakers.
```

**422 Kristine Hildebrandt**

```
In recent generations, many Mananges have migrated to
Kathmandu, or to lower elevations during winter, to benefit
from longer growing seasons and better education and employ-
ment opportunities. In winter, many women and children stay
in low-elevation villages where Nepali is spoken, while men
may travel to other regions for work. Although some Mananges
do remain in Manang year round, this number seems to be
declining.
Manange has a speaker population of under 5,000; it is thus
considered a small but relatively viable language, with some
prospect of endangerment. Despite displacement via emigration
of some speakers to Kathmandu, there is continued transmission of Manange to younger
generations. The primary factor contributing to an observed small-scale shift away from
Manange is the rise of access to formal education in Nepali for socioeconomic advance-
ment. However, several factors contribute to the retention of Manange, including positive
ethnic-group identity and prestige, and the comparative wealth of Mananges as entrepre-
neurs. Manange is neither the most nor the least viable language in comparison to other
nearby languages: the Gurung dialects Nepal-wide have over 200,000 speakers, while the
Phu dialect has perhaps only a couple of hundred.
```
3.2 **Typological Overview of Manange**

```
Because the Sino-Tibetan family comprises languages cover-
ing such a large area, typological descriptions recognize two
main types of languages from this family: languages of the
“Sinosphere” and languages of the “Indosphere.” Languages
in the Sinosphere are located mainly in Southeast Asia and are
analytic , with little inflectional and derivational morphology.
This does not mean they lack such traits altogether, but that
they tend to show morphological alternations via phonological
adjustments (e.g., tone) and tend to rely more heavily on phrasal
structures (e.g., compounds and strings of verbs called serial
verbs ) than on affixes. Root morphemes in analytic languages
are rarely longer than one syllable. In contrast, languages in the
Indosphere, which extends through the Himalayas and into
South Asia, have synthetic and agglutinative morphological
patterns, including affixes marking case, honorifics, tense, and
aspect. Root morphemes in synthetic languages may be poly-
syllabic, and these languages usually lack tone. However, com-
plicating this division are languages such as Manange, which
is geographically located in an Indospheric region, but which
shares some features with Sinospheric languages.

Retroflex consonants are
pronounced with the tongue curled
back and positioned just behind
the alveolar ridge. Manange has
two voiceless retroflex stops (plain
and aspirated), [ݚ] and [ݚh], plus
a voiceless retroflex fricative, [ʂ].
Retroflex consonants are also found
in Bardi, the subject of Language

3.2.1 Manange Phonology and Morphology
Manange has thirty consonant phonemes, including voiceless plain and aspirated stops
and affricates in the bilabial, dental, retroflex, palatal, velar, and glottal places of articula-
tion. Manange also has four nasals (/m, n, ɲ, ŋ/), and three fricatives (/s, ʂ, ʃ/). The conso-
nants also include approximants (/l, j, w/) and an alveolar tap (/ɾ/). In addition, there is a
labialized series of consonants, pronounced with lip rounding and a labial-velar off-glide:
/pw, pwh, mw, kw, kwh, ŋw/. The six vowel phonemes include: /i, u, e, o, ɑ, ʌ/; all vowels except
/ݞ/ have a nasalized counterpart.

### TEXTBOX LP3.3 TRANSCRIBING TONE IN MANANGE

```
This language profile marks the tones in Manange by
using small raised numbers at the end of the word
bearing the tone. These numbers indicate pitch height:
5 is the highest pitch and 1 the lowest. For example, a
```
```
52 tone starts high and falls dramatically, almost to the
bottom of the pitch range, while a 44 tone is fairly high
and level.
```
```
Manange has four tones, as illustrated by Example (1).
```
```

1 low level ʈ u^22 ‘stay’
2 high level ʈ u^44 ‘thread’
3 very high falling ʈ u^52 ‘cereal’
4 mid-high falling ʈ u^42 ‘six’
```
```
Some words, especially recent loanwords, do not carry a tone melody. For more on tone,
see Textbox LP3.4.
```
### TEXTBOX LP3.4 TONE LANGUAGES

```
A language that uses pitch as a primary means for
word or grammatical meaning contrast is said to be
tonal , or a tone language. While all languages use
pitch in some capacity (e.g., for affective, interactional,
or interrogative functions), tone languages use pitch
to signal differences in meaning in words. Tone is a
```
```
common feature of Sino-Tibetan languages. Manange
has four tones. Some Sino-Tibetan languages have
fewer than four tones (e.g., Meithei, spoken in
northeastern India, which has two tones), and some
have more (e.g., Cantonese, spoken in Guangdong
China, which has six).
```
### SIDEBAR LP3.5

```

described in this book are Engenni
(see Chapter 4) and the Goemai
Language Profile (LP2).
```
```
The morphological profile of Manange is largely analytic, with
a small number of suffixes and clitics, discussed below.
Elements in the noun phrase are structured into a particular
order:
```
```
DEMONSTRATIVE RELATIVE-CLAUSE noun ADJECTIVE NUMERAL = CLITIC
```

**424 Kristine Hildebrandt**

**(2) a.** Finite, with ergative and patient-marked animate object

```
nakju=ko=tse^22 nokor=ko=ri^22 t ʃʰƭ -tsi^22
dog=DEF=ERG cat=DEF=P catch-PRF
‘The dog caught the cat.’
```
### TEXTBOX LP3.5 CLITICS

```
Both clitics and affixes are bound morphemes.
However, affixes have more restricted distribution
than clitics, in that they occur only with words from a
single lexical class. A typical example is the past-tense
suffix in English, which can only be bound to verbs.
Clitics are much less restricted; they may attach to a
wider variety of host words. The possessive suffix ’s in
English is considered an enclitic (a clitic that follows
its host) because it attaches to a variety of hosts (in
conveying the grammatical meaning of possession),
e.g., to a noun in the guy’s car ; to a verb embedded in
a relative clause in the guy that you know’s car ; and to
the verb of an adverbial clause embedded into a larger
```
```
noun phrase in the guy that you met yesterday while
travelling’s car. In Manange, case-markers are analyzed
as clitics because they attach to the final element of the
noun phrase, regardless of its lexical class. For example,
the ergative case clitic, which marks the more agentlike
core argument of a transitive or ditransitive verb,
attaches to a noun in mi=tse^52 (man=ERG) ‘man’; to a
nominalized verb-like adjective in mi^52 m ɾ e-p ʌ =tse^44
(man fat-NOM=ERG) ‘fat man’; and to a numeral in mi^52
se ̃=tse^44 (man three=ERG) ‘three men.’ All three of these
noun phrases are in the ergative case, appropriate for
their use as subjects of a transitive clause.
```
```
Clitics (see Textbox LP3.5) are affix-like morphemes that in
Manange indicate noun plurality, definiteness, and case. There
are a number of clitic case markers. Of special importance here
is the clitic = tse , which marks the more agentive core argument
of a transitive clause; this is called an ergative marker (see the
Bardi Language Profile, Textbox LP8.3, for a fuller discussion of
ergativity; Tsez (LP7) is also ergative). The clitic = ri marks the
object noun phrase of a transitive clause when the object is both
animate and a semantic patient. Subjects of intransitive clauses
are unmarked.
Unlike many other “Indospheric” Tibeto-Burman languages,
Manange lacks verbal affixes that mark number, gender, case, or
the honorific status of referents. It also lacks grammatical mark-
ers for tense. There is a small set of verbal suffixes that mark
aspect and mood , and which are also used to link clauses
together in larger complex sentences. There is only one prefix,
the negative a -.
```
```
3.2.2 Manange Clause and Sentence Structure
The word order of basic constituents is generally SOV for transi-
tive clauses or SV for intransitive clauses. Clauses that have mark-
ers indicating aspect/mood and evidentiality are called finite
and mark the end of a sentence. Some examples are given in (2).
```
### SIDEBAR LP3.6

```
See Textbox LP3.8 below for an
explanation of aspect. See also
Chapter 5 or the Glossary (at the
back of this book or on the student
resources website) for definitions of
aspect and mood.
```
### SIDEBAR LP3.7

```
Evidentiality is described in Section
13.2.2. See also the Tsez and South
Conchucos Quechua Language
Profiles (LP6 and LP7) for additional
descriptions of evidential systems.
```
### SIDEBAR LP3.8

```
For other examples of languages
with clitics, see the Language Profiles
for Goemai (LP2), Finnish (LP4),

**425 Language Profile 3 Manange**

```
b. Finite, intransitive
ale=ko^22 nu^42 mo^22
boy=DEF sleep COP
’The boy sleeps.’
The finite markers in these examples are the perfective suffix - tsi and the present marker
mo^22. You can also see the ergative case-marker on the NP subject of the transitive verb, and
the object case-marker on the noun-phrase object of the transitive verb in (2a). The subject
of the intransitive verb in (2b) is unmarked.
In addition to finite clauses that are marked for mood, aspect, and/or evidentiality,
Manange also has many non-finite clauses, which lack marking for these categories. Verbs
in non-finite clauses typically have a suffix, -p ʌ, which is considered a nominalizer. This
nominalizer is used in the formation of relative clauses, complement clauses, purpose
clauses, and clauses that follow a sequential time ordering. Example (3) illustrates -p ʌ form-
ing a relative clause; note that there is no marking of evidentiality, aspect, or other finite
categories.
(3) se-p ʌ^22 mi^52
kill-NMLZ person
‘murderer’ (lit. ‘person who kills’ or ‘killing person’)
An important syntactic structure is the copula clause. A copula is a verb used to relate
a noun (the copula subject ) with another noun or an adjective (the copula comple-
ment ). In English, the copula is the verb be. In (4), the copula relates the copular subject to
a following noun, while in (5) it relates the copular subject to a following adjective.
```
```
(4) [My father]cs was [a teacher]cc
(5) [The baby]cs is [tired]cc
```
```
In Manange the copula is mo^22 ‘be,’ sometimes followed by an additional marker
mu^22 , which marks the speaker’s strength of commitment to the truth or validity of a
propositional utterance based on available evidence. Some examples of copula clauses in
Manange are given in (6); take a look at the clauses and try out the activity in Stop and
Reflect LP3.1 before reading on.

**427 Language Profile 3 Manange**

3.3 **Lexical Classes**

```
One of the more interesting properties of Manange is its lexical classes, particularly the class
of adjectives. Manange has syntactic and morphological evidence for two classes of adjec-
tives, which are both, in their own ways, distinct from nouns and verbs.
```
```
3.3.1 Nouns
Nouns represent the largest, most productive lexical class in Manange. Although most
words are monosyllabic and monormophemic, new words may be added to the lexicon
via compounding and via borrowing (see Textbox LP3.7, as well
as Chapter 13). Most commonly loanwords are borrowed from
Nepali, but there are also borrowings from English and other
languages. Table LP3.1 presents examples of monomorphemic
words, compounds, and loanwords from Nepali.
```
```
TEXTBOX LP3.6 ( cont. )
```
```
f. [ŋʌ^22 ]CS [ amtsi^22 ]CC mo^22
[ 1 SG]CS [doctor]CC COP
‘I am a doctor.’
```
```
g. nara ŋ^22 [ th ι̃= ko^42 ]CS [ t ʃ am-p ʌ^22 ]CC mo 22
before [house=DEF]CS [small-NMLZ]CC COP
‘The house was small before.’
The basic way in which copula clauses in Manange differ from copula clauses in English is
constituent order. In English, the constituent order is CS COPULA CC, while in Manange
it is CS CC COPULA, in accordance with Manange’s verb-final constituent ordering.
```
### TEXTBOX LP3.7 LOANWORDS

```
Loanwords are words that enter into a language from
another source language. Incorporating loanwords into
the borrowing language can be complicated by that
language’s morphology, although many languages
have strategies to remedy this. Manange, for example,
employs a “dummy” (semantically meaningless)
```
```
verb ti^44 , which immediately follows the loaned verb
(usually borrowed from Nepali) and carries the usual
derivational or inflectional morphology in the language
(e.g., Nepali rop ‘plant’ ĺ Manange rop ti-p ʌ^44 plant
V-NMLZ ‘to plant’).
```
### SIDEBAR LP3.10

```
For a full discussion of loanwords,
see Section 13.2. Textbox LP5.3
in the Nuuchahnulth Language
Profile discusses loanwords in that
language.
```
```
Nouns in Manange show a variety of morphological and syntactic properties that do
not apply to other lexical classes. Since nouns are frequently the final element in a noun
phrase, they may take enclitics. These include the plural enclitic = tse , case enclitics, and the
clitics = ko (DEF) and = ri (INDEF), which mark definiteness , the degree to which the entity
```

**428 Kristine Hildebrandt**

```
or concept a noun refers to is already known or has already
been introduced in a discourse context. None of these categories
co-occurs with verbs or adjectives in Manange.
```
**(7)** Plural marking

```

dog=PL sleep COP
‘The dogs sleep.’
```
**(8)** Definiteness and case-marking

```

```
Syntactically, nouns are the only lexical class that can serve as the head of a noun
phrase, while neither verbs nor adjectives may perform this function. Therefore, the
example in (10a) represents a possible noun phrase in Manange, while those in (10b) and
(10c) do not.

**429 Language Profile 3 Manange**

```
3.3.2 Verbs
Like nouns, verbs are also an also open class, with additions via compounding or borrowing
(although borrowed verbs in Manange are less frequent than borrowed nouns).
Verbs are clearly different from nouns in Manange; there are morphological and syntac-
tic properties that are unique to verbs. For example, verbs may be marked for aspectual
distinctions (see Textbox LP3.8 for a brief overview of aspect). In (11) perfective aspect is
marked by a suffix directly on the verb stem and in (12) progressive aspect is indicated by
both a suffix and the use of the copula as an auxiliary verb (compare English is running ).
In Manange, the auxiliary is placed after the main verb (which is marked with the pro-
gressive suffix, similar to - ing in English), and therefore occurs at the end of the clause.
```
### TEXTBOX LP3.8 ASPECT

```
Aspect is a grammatical category related to how
an event is expressed in temporal terms. Situations
expressed as unified completed wholes are in
perfective aspect, e.g., they fought , in contrast to
situations expressed from a viewpoint internal to the
situation, e.g., they are fighting ( progressive ) or they
```
```
often fight ( habitual ). The term imperfective includes
progressive, habitual, and other types of aspect.
Aspect is independent of tense; for example, situations
can be expressed in the past progressive ( were
fighting ), present progressive ( are fighting ), and future
progressive ( will be fighting ).
```
```
(11) Perfective
```
```
n ʌ kju=ko^22 kju-tsi^44
dog=DEF run-PRF
‘The dog has run.’
(12) Progressive
```
```
n ʌ kju=ko^22 toso^52 kju-tse^52 mo^22
dog=DEF now run-PROG COP
‘The dog is running right now.’
Another property unique to verbs is that they are the only lexical items that can take the
negative prefix a -. They are also the last constituent in most clauses.
```
```
(13) kje^22 a-te- ɾ o^44
voice NEG-take.out-IMP
‘Don’t make a sound.’
```
```
In English, many nouns may be treated formally as verbs simply by adding verbal mor-
phology (e.g., He moved the table ~ They tabled the vote ), but this is not possible in Manange.
Aspect/mood morphology and the negative prefix apply exclusively to verbs; nouns cannot
take these markers.
```

**430 Kristine Hildebrandt**

3.3.3 Adjectives

```
Unlike in many other languages, Manange has not one, but two types of adjectives: those
that behave as stereotypical adjectives from the point of view of an English speaker (called
“simple adjectives” here), and those that have some properties in common with verbs
(called “verb-like adjectives” here). These two types can be distinguished by their formal
properties both in the noun phrase, when they have attributive functions (i.e., provide
additional information about the noun within the noun phrase), and in the predicate,
when they have predicative functions (i.e., convey the primary information or proposition
of the clause). Both types of adjectives can be used in comparative and superlative construc-
tions (see Textbox LP3.9).
Simple adjectives in Manange constitute a small and closed class, meaning that it is unu-
sual for new items to be added to this class. This class of adjectives includes most color
terms and some words expressing semantic dimensions, such as human states and speed or
value. Some examples are given in Table LP3.2.
In attributive functions, simple adjectives follow the head noun. These adjectives appear
to be able to take inflectional morphology that identifies nouns, including plural, case, and
definiteness clitics, as shown in example (14).
```
```
TABLE LP3.2 Semantic categories of Manange simple adjectives
```
```
Color terms Human states Speed/Value
mle ŋ kja^22 ‘black’ kҦjokѶo^22 ‘old’ kini^52 ‘fast’
```
```
olkja^22 ‘red’ ŋ oto^52 ‘true/honest’ kole^42 ‘slow’
```
```
t ʌ rkja^22 ‘white’
```
**(14)** [ _kҦje_^42 _t҄Ѷkja=ri_^22 ] _ï҄_^22 _por_^52 _j_ ʌ^22 _mo_^22
[road white=LOC]1SG take go COP
‘I take (the prayer scarf) on the white road (to heaven).’

```
However, because these inflectional markers are clitics (not affixes), they have a freer dis-
tribution, attaching to any element that is final in the noun phrase, including adjectives,
numerals, nouns, and determiners. Unlike nouns (but like verbs and verb-like adjectives),
simple adjectives cannot be the single (head) element of a noun phrase, so a structure like
* t ʌ Ѷkja=ri^22 ȧ ʌ^22 poѶ^52 j ʌ^22 mo^22 , where the color word t҄Ѷkja^22 ‘white’ is the head of the NP, is
not acceptable.
```
```
Simple adjectives may be used with the verb ‘be’ in a copula construction. This is also
true of nouns. Adjectives and nouns that occur with a copula are said to be the copula
complements.
```

### TEXTBOX LP3.9 COMPARATIVES AND SUPERLATIVES

```
In English, adjectives can be placed in comparative and superlative constructions, either through suffixation, via
a “more/most” phrasal structure, or through suppletion of the root (e.g., red/redder/reddest, delicious/more/most
delicious, bad/worse/worst ). This helps to distinguish adjectives from other lexical classes that cannot do this (e.g.,
*table/tabler/tablest ). In Manange, comparatives and superlatives are formed with the same strategy, a phrasal
structure that can be glossed as ‘say-comparative.’ Examples are shown here with khjokro^22 ‘old (of an animate
being).’
```
```
(15) Noun as a complement of the copula mo ‘be’
[ u^22 ʃʌ .k ʌ= ko^52 ]cs [ tore^52 ]cc [ a- ɾ e^2 mo^22 ]PREDICATE
[DIST.DEM glacier=DEF]cs [graveyard]cc [NEG-COP COP]PREDICATE
‘That glacier place was not a graveyard (a long time ago).’
(16) Simple adjective as a syntactic complement of the copula mo ‘be’
[ p ʰ olp ʌ^42 t ʰ aï = ko^44 ]cs [ t ʰẽ^22 ]cc [ mo^22 mu^22 ]PREDICATE
[frog pot=DEF]cs [empty]COMP [COP EVID]PREDICATE
‘The frog pot (pot where the frog lived) was empty.’
Like nouns, but unlike verbs, simple adjectives in the predicate are not directly marked
for aspect or mood distinctions, nor do they occur before an evidential marker. Instead, the
copula t҄^22 ‘become’ is used; it follows the adjective, hosts this morphology, and precedes
any evidentials.
(17) The copula t҄ ‘become’ following a noun
[ kju^44 tso=ko^44 ]cs [ thi ]cc [ t ʌ -tsi^22 ]PREDICATE
[water PROX.DEM=DEF]cs [lake]cc [become-PRF]PREDICATE
‘This water became a lake.’
(18) The copula t҄ ‘become’ following a simple adjective
[ k ʰ i^22 ]cs [ kat h e ]cc [ t ʌ -tsi^22 ]PREDICATE
[3SG]cs [thin]cc [become-PRF]PREDICATE
‘He became thin.’
```
```
a. u^22 n҄kju^22 khjokro^22 mo^22
DIST.DEM dog old COP
‘That dog is old.’
b. u^22 n҄kju^22 tsu^44 n҄kju^22 pi-le^52 khjokѶo^22 mo^22
DIST.DEM dog PROX.DEM dog say-COMPAR old COP
‘This dog is older than that dog.’ (lit. ‘Compared to that dog, this dog is old.’)
c. tsu^44 n҄kju=ko^22 tshaѶaƾ^44 pi-le^52 khjokro^22 mo^22
PROX.DEM dog=DEF all say-COMPAR old COP
‘This dog is the oldest of all.’ (lit. ‘Compared to all dogs, this dog is old.’)
This structure is not uncommon in languages of South Asia, both in Tibeto-Burman and in Indo-European families.
```

**432 Kristine Hildebrandt**

```
In this construction, both adjectives and nouns are acceptable copula complements, and
the verb t ʌ^22 ‘become’ is the copula.
Again like nouns, but unlike verbs, simple adjectives do not occur with the negative mor-
pheme prefix. To negate a copula clause, a suppletive (highly irregular) form of the copula
is used, creating a complex predicate.
```
**(19)** Suppletive copula following noun

```
[ u^22 ]cs [ to ɾ e^52 ]cc [ a- ɾ e^22 mo^22 ]PREDICATE
[DIST.DEM]cs [graveyard]cc [NEG-COP COP]PREDICATE
‘That (piece of land) was not a graveyard (back then).’
```
**(20)** Suppletive copula following adjective

```
[ u^22 n ʌ kju^2^2 ]cs [ mle ŋ ka^22 ]cc [ a- ɾ e^22 mo^22 ]PREDICATE
[DIST.DEM dog]cs [black]cc [NEG-COP COP]PREDICATE
‘That dog is not black.’
In contrast to simple adjectives, the class of verb-like adjectives is larger and is open to
new membership via compounding. Some examples of verb-like adjectives are provided in
Table LP3.3, along with some of the semantic dimensions that they can express.
Not surprisingly, verb-like adjectives have some formal properties in common with verbs,
but there are also some crucial ways in which they are different. In attributive functions,
verb-like adjectives follow the noun; in this way, they are similar to simple adjectives.
However, they may not occur as bare stems in this position but must take a suffix -p ʌ,
glossed here as NMLZ for “nominalizer,” following common practice in Tibeto-Burman lin-
guistics. If verb-like adjectives occur in final position in the noun phrase, then like other
lexical items, they may host the full range of clitics (plural, case, or definiteness). Example
(21) illustrates an attributive verb-like adjective in NP-final position.
```
```
TABLE LP3.3 Semantic categories of Manange verb-like adjectives
```
```

s ẽ^22 ‘young’ k ũ^44 ‘expensive’ ʃ a^22 ‘cracked/broken’ thj ʌ^22 ‘big’

```

```
```
t ʃ ã^52 ‘new’ n ʌ^44 ‘ill’ k ι̃ 22 ‘bitter’ ɾ u ŋ^52 ‘long’
```
```
ʂ u ŋ^44 ‘brief’ tsa ŋ^44 ‘clean’ kha ŋ^44 ‘cold climate’ p ʰɾʌ^44 ‘thin/fine’

water big-NMLZ=LOC throw become-PRF
‘The ashes were thrown in big water (like a river).’

```
Verbs can also be used to modify nouns within the noun phrase, in which case they also
take the nominalizing suffix. However, while verb-like adjectives follow the noun in the
noun phrase, a modifying verb must precede the noun, as in example (22).
```

**433 Language Profile 3 Manange**

```
(22) ŋʌ =tse^22 [ khol-p ʌ^42 kju=ko^42 ]NP thu ŋ -tsi^42
1 SG=ERG [boil-NMLZ water=DEF] drink-PRF
‘I drank the boiled water.’
```
```
In (21) the verb-like adjective thj ʌ -p ʌ^22 ‘big-NMLZ’ follows the head noun kju^44 ‘water,’ while
in (22) the nominalized verb k h ol-p ʌ^42 ‘boil-NMLZ’ precedes the head noun kju^44 ‘water.’ Thus,
although both verb-like adjectives and verbs are marked with the nominalizer suffix  - p ʌ,
they have distinct NP positions in attributive functions. In this sense, verb-like adjectives
are more similar to simple adjectives than to verbs; adjectives of both classes occur in
post-nominal position in the noun phrase, while verbs occur in pre-nominal position.
When used as predicate adjectives, verb-like adjectives show some, but not all, of the
morphological properties of verbs. Both simple adjectives and verbs are marked with the
perfective suffix -tsi , as shown in (23) and (24).
```
```
(23) The perfective -tsi suffix marking a verb
k h i^22 k hʌ -tsi^22
3 SG come-PRF
‘He came.’
(24) The perfective -tsi suffix marking a verb-like adjective
k h i^22 t h j ʌ -tsi^22
3 SG big-PRF
‘He was big.’
These examples show that verbs and verb-like adjectives can have similar morphological
behavior and parallel syntactic structure when they function as predicates. However, this is
not always the case. While verbs can be marked by the negative prefix a- directly, verb-like
adjectives cannot. To negate a verb-like adjective, speakers must use the suppletive negative
copula a-re^22 ; the verb-like adjective then occurs as the complement to the copula. This
structure is illustrated in examples (25) and (26):
```
```
(25) Negation marked on a verb
k h i^22 a-kh ʌ^22 (mo^22 )
3 SG NEG-come (COP)
‘He doesn’t come.’
(26) Negation marked via suppletive copula for a verb-like adjective
mi^52 mile=ko^22 ʂ u ŋ -p ʌ^44 a- ɾ e^22 mo^22
person life=DEF short-NMLZ NEG-COP COP
‘Man’s life is not short.’
We have seen that in some ways verb-like adjectives are structurally identical to verbs: they
both are marked with the nominalizer suffix -p҄ in an attributive construction and verb-like
adjectives can take a limited range of aspect morphology similar to verbs when used in pre-
dicative constructions. However, in other ways verb-like adjectives are different from verbs:
they show a different ordering with respect to the head noun in the noun phrase and, when
negated in the predicate, they occupy the copula complement position and cannot carry

### CHAPTER SUMMARY

```
Manange is a Tibeto-Burman language spoken in a mountainous region in Nepal. It
has a number of interesting typological features, including tone, clitics, and marking
of evidentiality. This language profile has especially focused on lexical classes and
argued for the presence of two distinct classes of adjective. This ties in with a point
made in Chapter 5 that different languages have different sets of word classes and that
in each language it is important to look at the detailed phonological and grammatical
properties of words in order to determine which class they fall into. The properties that
are used to identify a particular word class in one language may not do so in another;
what is true of word classes is also true of many other aspects of the grammar.

4.1.1 Genetic Affiliation

```
Finnish belongs to the Baltic-Finnic branch of the Finno-Ugric family of languages which
is in turn a part of the Uralic family. Some of its closest relatives are Meankieli, a minority
language spoken in Sweden, and Estonian. Finnish is also related to the Sami languages
spoken in Lapland and to Hungarian, and more distantly to the Samoyed languages, which
form the other group of the Uralic languages in addition to the Finno-Ugric languages.
```
4.1.2 Official Status and Viability

```
Finnish is one of the two official languages of Finland and is spoken by more than 90 per-
cent of Finns as a first language. The other official language is Swedish, spoken by less than
6 percent of the population (see Textbox LP4.1). Finnish is one of the official languages of
the European Union, and it also has official status as a minority language in Sweden. All
Finnish-speaking residents of the Nordic countries are entitled to use their language in
official contexts. In Finland, education in Finnish is available through the university level,

4.2 Typological Overview
4.2.1 Phonology
Finnish has a relatively simple inventory of consonants: it has three voiceless stops [p, t,
k], one voiced stop [d] (some dialects, though, lack this sound), three nasals [m, n, ƞ], three
fricatives [s, h, v], two liquids [l, r], and the semivowel [j]. Borrowed words can also contain
[b] and [g].
Finnish has eight vowels. In the International Phonetic Alphabet, these are represented
as [i, e, y, ø, æ, a, u, o]. Two of the vowels, [y] and [ø], are front rounded vowels, which
are pronounced with the tongue position of [i] and [e] respectively, but with the lips fully
rounded. These sounds are relatively uncommon in the world’s languages; however, they
may be familiar to you from French (e.g., [y] in rue ‘street,’ and [ø] in peu ‘few’), German
(e.g., [y] in kühe ‘cows’ and [ø] in schön ‘beautiful’), or Cantonese (e.g., [y] in syu^1 ‘book’ and
[ø] in heu^1 ‘boots’). English lacks these vowels.
Finnish also has quite a few diphthongs, among them are [yø], [øy], [ie], [æi], [ui], and
[iu]. Some of these diphthongs form whole words, e.g., [yø] yö ‘night’ and [ui] ui ‘swim!’

### TEXTBOX LP4.2 GEMINATE CONSONANTS

```
Geminate consonants occur only rarely in English, when
they arise across morpheme boundaries. For example,
there is a geminate /n/ in the word unnamed (compare
this with unaimed ). Geminate consonants may also be
```
```
familiar to you if you have heard native pronunciations
of Italian; e.g., there is a geminate stop before the final
vowel in spaghetti.
```
```
Finnish has vowel harmony ; this means that only certain
vowels can occur with each other in Finnish words. Three of
the front vowels, [y, ø, æ], cannot occur in the same word with
any of the back vowels, [a, o, u]. However, the other two front
vowels, [i, e], are neutral with respect to vowel harmony: they
can occur in the same word with either of the other two groups
of vowels. These patterns can be seen in Table LP4.1, which
provides examples of singular and plural nouns with two case suffixes, the inessive ( -ssA;
where the capitalized vowel symbol indicates that it undergoes harmony) and the alla-
tive (- lle ). (More information on Finnish case-marking is given below.) Notice that the
vowels in the singular and plural inessive suffixes are affected by vowel harmony: the
front vowel [æ] is found when the root has [y] or [ø]; and the back vowel [a] is found
when the root contains [u] or [o]. Contrast this with the vowel in the allative suffix and
with the plural [i], which are neutral vowels and so do not change.
Finnish has both long vowels and long consonants; thus, length is phonemic for both
consonants and vowels. We can see this in the two minimal sets in Example (1).
```
**(1)**

```
Long consonants are also called geminate consonants (see Textbox LP4.2). In addition
to having increased duration, they form a bridge across two syllables, closing off one and
starting another.
Stress is predictable in Finnish: it always falls on the first syllable of a word.

4.2.2 Morphology
Finnish has a relatively complex system of inflectional morphology, especially on nouns, adjec-
tives, and pronouns (referred to as nominals in Finnish linguistics). It is especially known for
its case-marking; it has one of the largest numbers of cases of any language in the world. A given
nominal can have up to fifteen different case forms. Case-marking will be discussed in detail below.
Finnish is predominantly a suffixing language. Number, case,
and agreement with a possessor are all suffixed on nominals,
while tense, mood, and person are suffixed on verbs. There is also
a system of clitics, which occur on various word classes and have
a variety of meanings. One example is the question clitic = kO
(which undergoes vowel harmony; the capital O in the transcrip-
tion means that one of two vowels, [o] or [ø], can occur there, depending on the harmonic
pattern of the root). This can be affixed to a questioned constituent of any word class. Some
examples of words with complex morphology are given in (2).

‘Mother has fixed food here.’
**b.** _äiti ol-i teh-ny täs ruoka-a_

Finnish also uses a special auxiliary verb to mark negation. This verb has limited inflec-
tion. It does have person marking; however, it does not inflect for tense. The tense is indexed
by the different forms of the main verb, as can be seen by comparing (5) and (6).

4.2.3 Syntax
Adpositions
Finnish has both prepositions and postpositions, although postpositions are more com-
mon. The dependent noun phrases that occur with prepositions are most commonly in the
partitive case, while those that occur with postpositions are most
commonly in the genitive case. (The cases are discussed below.)
You can see this difference in case by comparing the pronoun
that occurs with the preposition in (7), and that which occurs
with the postposition in (8).

### SIDEBAR LP4.4

adpositions (prepositions and

Some adpositions can be used as both prepositions and postpositions, and may accord-
ingly co-occur with noun phrases which are either partitive or genitive. For these adpo-
sitions, there may be a difference in meaning in postpositional and prepositional use, as
illustrated below for ympäri ‘around.’

Constituent Order
Constituent order in Finnish can be said to be flexible, as there is no arrangement of S, V,
and O in a basic sentence that is ungrammatical; that is, all the orders in (11) are gram-
matical in Finnish. However, when the language is used, SVO is the overwhelmingly most
common word order, a fact that can be determined by quantitative analysis of both written
and spoken Finnish discourse.
```

4.3 Case in Finnish
As noted above, Finnish is rich in case morphology. In a study of 261 languages, only 24
were found to have more than ten cases (Iggesen 2011). The largest number of cases that
has been found in a single language is twenty-one. These were in Hungarian, a language
related to Finnish. Finnish itself has fourteen productive cases. These are presented in Table
LP4.2 below, which shows the inflection of the noun talo ‘house.’ The names of the cases
(taken from Latin) are also given. The meanings of the cases and uses of the cases will be
discussed below.
```
```
‘around the (circumference of) house’
```
**(10)**


**446 Ritva Laury**

```
The nominative, partitive, accusative, and sometimes also the
genitive are the core cases in Finnish; they are used to mark core
arguments such as subjects and objects. The rest of the cases are the
oblique cases, which mostly code a variety of locational semantic
roles (these expand the inventory given in Section 6.3.5).
```
4.3.1 Core Cases

```
Most subjects in Finnish are in nominative case. The Finnish verb agrees with the subject
when it is nominative, as in Example (12) below. Objects can be in the accusative case or
the partitive case. Objects are in the accusative case if the referent of the object is affected
by the action of the verb. If the referent is not affected, then the object is in partitive case.
For example, objects in negated sentences, in which, of course, the object is not affected at
all, are in the partitive, as in (12).

**(12)** _minä e-n juo kahvi-a_
1 SG.NOM NEG-1SG drink coffee-PRT
‘I’m not drinking coffee; I don’t drink coffee.’
In addition, the object is in partitive case when the referent of the object NP is indefinite,
when it is only partially affected by the action expressed by the verb, or when the verb does
not refer to specific events with completed endpoints. Hence the partitive case is found in (13).


**447 Language Profile 4 Finnish**

```
äiti tek-i täs ruoka-a
mother.NOM make-PST here food-PRT
‘Mother fixed food here.’
```
### (13)

```
This clause does not express a particular instance of Mother cooking, with a clear endpoint,
or particular food being prepared, but rather a generic process of food-making without a
clear endpoint. Contrast this with Example (14), where the accusative case occurs.
```
```
mummo=kin aina laitta-a se-n laakeese-en
grandma.NOM=CLT always put-3SG 3 SG-ACC shallow-ILL
‘Grandma also always puts it in a shallow [dish].’
```
```
Here, the action has a clear endpoint of the food being in the shallow dish. Also, after
Grandma puts the food in the shallow dish, it has been affected by being transferred into
a location.
Recipients in ditransitive clauses are also core arguments; they are in the allative case as
exemplified in (15).
```
```
minä osta-n sinu-lle kahvi-n

‘I’m buying/will buy you a (cup of) coffee.’

**448 Ritva Laury**

```
As you can see, the majority of the meanings are concerned
with spatial arrangement and movement trajectories; these are
termed “local cases” (similar to the locative case in other lan-
guages) as they indicate different types of location.
Finnish has both an “internal” and an “external” set of local
cases. To simplify slightly, the basic meaning of the internal local
cases (the inessive, elative, and illative) is to express movement
to or from, or location on the inside of some reference point. The
external cases (adessive, ablative, and allative) express movement
to or from, or location on the outside of something. Consider the
following examples.
```
### SIDEBAR LP4.6

```
You may have noted that the
first-person singular pronoun
here is mää , while in previous
examples it was minä. This
represents regional variation (see
Chapter 11). The presence of
socially determined variation is
frequently a feature of examples
taken from naturally occurring
discourse, such as these.
```
**(16)** 1. _ja si-in puu-hella-lla_
and there-LAT wood-stove-AD
‘and there on the wood stove’

2. _kerran ni_
    once PTC
    ‘one time’
3. _mää illa-lla paisto-i-n_
1 SG evening-AD fry-PST-1SG
‘I was frying [mushrooms] in the evening.’

```
In line 1, the noun puuhellalla ‘on the wood stove’ is in the adessive case; the choice of
case here could be thought to be motivated by the fact that frying happens on the outside
surface of the stove, with the stove providing support. Compare this with the next example.
```
**(17)** 1. _kana tul-i sisä-än ja_
chicken come-PST inside-ILL and
‘[A] chicken came in and’

2. (^) _hyppä-s kiisseli-vati-in_
jump-PST pudding-dish-ILL
‘jumped into [a] pudding dish’
In line 2, the word _kiisselivatiin_ ‘into the pudding dish’ is in the illative case. Here,
the case can be thought to express the movement of the chicken to the inside of the
pudding dish. Notice also that the adverb _sisään_ in line 1 is in the illative case as well.
It is not uncommon for locational adverbs and even adpositions to have partial para-
digms in the locative cases; this is the case with the adverb _sisä_ -, which has forms for
all the local cases. See Textbox LP4.3 for a note on the historical development of cases
in Finnish.


**449 Language Profile 4 Finnish**

4.4 **A Syntactic Conundrum: The Habitive Construction**

```
The local cases are a considerable resource in the Finnish language. They are also used to
express more abstract relations than mere location. An important use of the adessive case is in
a particular type of possessive construction called the habitive. This construction is one way
that Finnish indicates possession, a function accomplished in English by the verb to have.
```
```
The internal and external local cases developed
relatively recently, perhaps from postpositions. Before
that, the partitive, the essive, and the lative cases
expressed location. They expressed, respectively,
movement from, location in, and movement to a
reference point. These cases are still used in connection
with some adverbials. For example, the partitive is used
to express motion away in ulko-a ‘from the outside’
```
```
and koto-a ‘from home.’ We find the essive used in
expressions indicating static location, such as ulko-na
‘outside’ and koto-na ‘at home.’ With most nouns in
modern Finnish, the partitive is a core case, marking
objects (as discussed above), and the essive expresses a
state or role, e.g., opettaja-na ‘as a teacher,’ sairaa-na
‘(while being) sick.’ The lative shows up in certain
adverbs such as ulo-s ‘out, to the outdoors.’
```

In the Finnish habitive construction, the possessor NP (in this example _mei-ll(ä)_ , given
in bold) is in the adessive case, and the head noun of the possessed NP is in either the
nominative (e.g., the underlined _Hirvensalon saunakamari_ ‘the Hirvensalo sauna room’ in
this example), the partitive, or (if the possessed NP is a pronoun) the accusative case. (See
Textbox LP4.4 for more on _saunakamari_ in Finland.)

### TEXTBOX LP4.4 THE SAUNAKAMARI IN FINLAND

```
The sauna (steam bath) is an important part of
traditional Finnish culture. The term saunakamari
literally means ‘sauna room,’ but this is not a very
satisfactory translation. The word refers to a room in
a sauna building. Traditionally this room was separate
from the room with the sauna itself and could be used
as a dressing room. In earlier times, a sauna was often
built on a new farm before the main living building
```
```
was built, and in that case, the saunakamari could be
used as an initial living space with cooking and sleeping
facilities. The photograph in Figure LP4.4 shows a
modern saunakamari. It is used as a sauna dressing
room, but it also serves as an extra sleeping area. There
is also a hot plate – suitable for simple cooking – on top
of the wood stove, with which the room can be heated
during the cold time of the year.
```

**450 Ritva Laury**

```
This causes problems for the constituency analysis of the possessive construction. What
should be considered the subject of the expression? Most Finnish subjects are nominative,
are clause-initial, and trigger agreement in the verb. An example is the first clause in (18a),
mä muista-n ‘I remember,’ where the clause-initial subject is a nominative first-person pro-
noun and the verb is accordingly in the first-person singular form.
The possessive construction has two core arguments: the possessor and the possessed.
Which is the subject? The possessor argument is not a very good candidate, since it is in an
oblique case (the adessive), and the verb does not agree with it in either person or number; the
possessor is a first-person plural pronoun, but the verb is in the third-person singular form.
On the other hand, the possessed noun phrase is not a very typical subject either. It is
clause-final and although it can be in the nominative case, as in Example (18) above, it can
also be in the partitive or even the accusative case. As the partitive and accusative cases are
typically found on objects (see Textbox LP4.5), there is an inherent contradiction between
the possessed noun carrying these case-markers and the grammatical relation of subject.
```
```
Figure LP4.4 A modern saunakamari (photo by Raimo Hyvönen)
```
### TEXTBOX LP4.5 WHY PARTITIVE CASE FOR OBJECTS?

```
As we have seen, Finnish shows clear historical evidence
of a dynamic interaction between core and oblique
cases. Oblique cases have been recruited into more
grammatical uses and so now mark core arguments.
```
```
How might a noun phrase carrying an oblique case-
marker – such as the partitive – be reanalyzed as a
grammatical object? Consider Example (a), which has a
partitive noun phrase.
```

**451 Language Profile 4 Finnish**

```
In modern Finnish, this clause, with its partitive
noun phrase, means ‘we ate (some) fish,’ where
kala-a is a partitive-marked object. Earlier, however,
it might have meant something like ‘we ate from the
fish,’ where the partitive noun phrase would have
been oblique. Of course, a person eating from a fish
```
```
logically entails a person eating fish, so semantically
it makes sense to reinterpret the oblique locational
noun phrase as a (core) object. Some of the semantics
of the partitive expression remain, including the
implication that only a partial, indefinite amount of
the fish was eaten.
This example shows that there is a dynamic interplay
between core and oblique cases, with the semantics
of specific cases allowing for reinterpretation of the
grammatical nature of arguments.
```
```
TEXTBOX LP4.5 ( cont. )
```
```
a. söimme kala-a
eat-PST-1PL fish-PRT
‘We ate (some) fish’
```
```
There is further evidence that the possessed noun phrase has the syntactic behavior of
an object. This is found in the negation of the habitive construction, which necessarily
puts the possessed noun phrase in the partitive case, as in (19), which is the negated coun-
terpart of (18).
```
```
toinen on laitta-nu se-n vielä
another be fix-PST.PTCP 3 SG-ACC even
‘Someone else has even fixed it.’
```
### (20)

```
(21) toinen ei oo laitta-nu si-tä vielä
another NEG be fix-PST.PTCP 3 SG-PRT even
‘Someone else hasn’t even fixed it.’
```
```
In these examples, the object se-n is in the accusative case in the affirmative version in (20),
yet in the partitive case, si-tä , in the negative version in (21). The shift to partitive under
negation shows an exact syntactic parallel between the possessed noun phrase in the habi-
tive construction and the object noun phrase of a transitive clause.
We may thus want to say that in the habitive construc-
tion, there is not very good evidence at all for the existence
of a subject constituent, even though ordinary Finnish transi-
tive and intransitive clauses give clear evidence of subject and
object constituents. Thus, it is reasonable to consider Finnish
a nominative-accusative language, but to recognize that the

```

**452 Ritva Laury**

grammatical relations of subject and object are not relevant in every type of construction.
(This is also true for English; consider cases such as There is a boat or It is raining .)
```
### SUMMARY

```
Finnish is a Baltic-Finnish language which has a number of features that are quite
unlike those of the Germanic, Romance, and Slavic languages that are found
throughout much of Europe. Especially notable features include vowel harmony,
geminate consonants, the presence of both prepositions and postpositions, and
extensive inflectional morphology. Within the latter, the case system is particularly
remarkable for the fine-grained semantic distinctions that are made with regards to
spatial arrangement and movement trajectories. Finnish is also instructive with respect
to grammatical relations; while some constructions clearly delineate subjects and
objects, these categories are not relevant to the habitive construction.

### EXERCISES

**1.** Finnish exhibits a series of alternations in consonants referred to as lenition. This can be seen in the
    examples below, which show the regular consonant realization that is found in both the nominative and
    the partitive forms, and the lenited consonant realization that is found in the genitive forms.
    **i.** List each change exemplified in the data (e.g., t > d).
    **ii.** Which natural classes of sound are affected by the lenition process? Can you write any general rules
       that apply to more than one example?
    **iii.** What would you predict would be the genitive form of _kukka_ ‘flower’?
       NOM PRT GEN
**a.** _mato matoa madon_ ‘worm’
**b.** _tapa tapaa tavan_ ‘manner’
**c.** _ratti rattia ratin_ ‘steering wheel’

    you know about Finnish cases. Can you make a guess as to why there is no preposition before ‘your lost
    articles’ in (b)?

**LANGUAGE PROFILE 5**

Nuuchahnulth (Nootka)

5.1 **Introduction**

```
Nuuchahnulth [nu:tʃa:ʔnuɬ] is spoken on the west coast of Vancouver Island in south-
western British Columbia, Canada. The language and the people were formerly known as
Nootka , a name used since the time of contact by Captain Cook. However, since the name
Nuuchahnulth (meaning ‘[those who live] all along the mountains’) was adopted as the offi-
cial designation by the Nuuchahnulth people in 1978, it has been the preferred designation
for themselves and their language.

```
```
Nuuchahnulth belongs to the southern branch of the Wakashan language family.
There is a significant amount of dialectal variation within the language, especially in
phonology. However, owing to language endangerment and amalgamation among var-
ious groups that were previously distinct, the dialectal differences are being lost to a
certain degree.
```
```
5.1.1 Speech Community
The number of speakers has been estimated to be a few hundred, but the number is decreas-
ing very rapidly. Most fluent speakers are in their seventies and higher and are also very
fluent in English. Younger Nuuchahnulth community members are monolingual English
speakers. Everyday communication within the local communities is conducted almost exclu-
sively in English, and Nuuchahnulth is heard only occasionally, for example, in ceremo-
nial speeches. Consequently, English is becoming the primary language of communication
```

**458 Toshihide Nakayama**

```
even for fluent Nuuchahnulth speakers, and Nuuchahnulth is not actively acquired by
children. In these respects Nuuchahnulth can be characterized as a highly endangered lan-
guage. Efforts to revitalize the traditional language have been made with varying degrees of
success. Generally speaking, however, they have yet to make a measurable impact on the
endangerment of the language.

### TEXTBOX LP5.1 TRANSCRIPTION CONVENTIONS FOR NUUCHAHNULTH

```
Where transcriptional practice varies from IPA, phonetic values are given in square brackets. Note
especially the following:
[ݳ] pharyngeal stop (transcribed ʕ )
```
```
[ħ] voiceless pharyngeal fricative (transcribed ḥ)
```
```

```
```

```
```

```
```
Sounds indicated in parentheses in Table LP5.1 are rarely used.
```
```
Nuuchahnulth, like other languages from the Pacific Northwest
Coast region of North America, has a well-developed consonant
system (see Textbox LP5.1 for some transcription conventions
used for this and other languages of the Pacific Northwest; other
conventions are noted in sidebars throughout the chapter).
Among the notable features are the following: some relatively
uncommon sounds, most significantly ejectives and pharyn-
geals ; a rich set of lateral consonants; and a contrast between rounded (i.e., pronounced
with rounded lips and a labial-velar off-glide) and unrounded obstruents in the velar and
uvular places of articulation.
Nuuchahnulth lacks a voicing contrast in consonants. Instead, the primary contrast
in obstruents is in glottalized (ejective) versus non-glottalized (plain) consonants. The
inventory of consonant phonemes in Nuuchahnulth is given in Table LP5.1; phonetic
forms are given in square brackets when different from the standard Nuuchahnulth
orthography. (Textbox LP5.2 discusses why orthographic practice frequently differs from
the IPA.)

### TEXTBOX LP5.2 TRANSCRIPTION CONVENTIONS AND THE INTERNATIONAL

### PHONETIC ALPHABET

```
As you will have already noted, many linguists do not
use pure IPA for everyday orthographic practice. While
most transcription systems are at least based on the
IPA, they may vary from it in particular ways. There
are many reasons for this, most commonly related to
early print technologies, as producing IPA symbols
on standard typewriters in the nineteenth and most
of the twentieth century was tedious and required
specialized equipment. So linguists substituted easily
typeable symbols, or combinations of symbols, for
particular phonetic characters. These symbols then
became conventionalized for particular languages or
regions. With the advent of computer technologies,
the production of IPA symbols has become increasingly
easier, but people still follow established conventions.
A big advantage of this is that all the data for a given
language is represented the same way, rather than
```
```
having it be transcribed one way in older materials,
and a different way in more recent materials.
Typically, transcriptional practices become
standardized for a given region, as linguists working
within a given region tend to talk to each other,
read each other’s work, and follow the same
conventions. One of the tasks in learning linguistics
is to get used to different transcription systems, and
figure out how to interpret them phonetically in
each case. Examples of some regional conventions
include the use of the numeral 7 to indicate [ʔ] in
Mayan languages, the use of a comma typed under
a vowel to indicate nasalization in South American
languages (e.g., e ̧ for [Ӂ]), and the use of an under-
dot to indicate retroflex consonants in South Asian
languages (e.g., ṭ for [ݚ]).
```
```
Glottalized sonorants, such as those found in Nuuchahnulth,
are comparatively rare in the world’s languages. In this language
they are produced with a glottal closure preceeding the pro-
duction of the sonorant. Note that orthographic conventions
for Nuuchahnulth place apostrophes indicating glottalization
above (not to the right of) the affected segment.
Compared to the elaboration found in the consonant system, the vowel system in
Nuuchahnulth is rather simple, consisting of three vowels, i, a , and u , with a two-way
length distinction.
```
### SIDEBAR LP5.2

```
Vowel length is indicated by the
doubling of the vowel symbol, e.g.,
ii for [iޝ].

5.2.2 Word Formation

```
Word formation in Nuuchahnulth can be very complex. The complexity is introduced
exclusively through the attachment of affixes, most of which are suffixes. There is no
compounding (combining of multiple roots) in Nuuchahnulth. The richest word for-
mation is found in verbs. The suffixes involved in verb formation in Nuuchahnulth
include not only those indicating grammatical relations and configurations, such
as moods, persons of the subject, aspects, possessive, and causative, but also those
expressing concrete lexical meanings. The suffixes of the latter kind are rather unusual
cross-linguistically. Affixes commonly encode grammatical functions rather than lex-
ical meanings.

```
### TEXTBOX LP5.3 LOANWORDS

```
When words are borrowed from a foreign language,
sounds and word shapes that are foreign to the
language are usually modified to fit to the native
morphophonological structure (this phenomenon
is referred to as adaptation as discussed in Section
13.2.1). The pattern of modifications found in
loanwords, therefore, provides us with an interesting
perspective on the way the sound and word structures
vary among languages.
The following are examples of Nuuchahnulth words
borrowed from English. From the way original sounds
are modified in these words, we can see the differences
between the Nuuchahnulth and English sound systems.
Notice what happened to the consonants that are not
part of the Nuuchahnulth sound system, i.e., [b], [d],
and [f].
muut < boat
taana < dollar
kwapi < coffee
```
```
More interestingly, the borrowed words began to
follow the morphological patterns of the language
once they started to be felt as part of the lexicon of
the language. In Nuuchahnulth, free roots ending
in /n/ have separate connecting forms for use with
suffixes:
saasin ‘humming bird’ > sasitq-
kշ aa ʔ in ‘crow’ > kշ a ʔ itq-
cތ itin ‘money given away at potlach’ > cތ ititq-
The rule is (i) to shorten the first vowel if it is long and
(ii) to replace the final /n/ with /tq/. See what happens
with loanwords that end in /n/:
saamin ‘salmon’ > samitq- as in samitq-ašt ‘dried
salmon’ (- ašt ‘dried food’)
taawin ‘town’ > tawitq-
Although these words originated in English, they now
behave like native Nuuchahnulth words.
```
```
Given how different the phonological inventories of English and Nuuchahnulth are,
examining how English words are adapted into Nuuchahnulth is especially interesting; see
Textbox LP5.3.
```

**461 Language Profile 5 Nuuchahnulth (Nootka)**

```
The suffixes expressing concrete lexical meanings (sometimes called “lexical suffixes”) give
the word formation in Nuuchahnulth a very different feel from that in European languages.
Notice the amount of information that can be packed into a single Nuuchahnulth word:
```
```
(1) tշitؓaaqsti ɫ maۊsapniš
tշiqw- ’a·qsta- ’i ɫ -maۊsa= ’ap=ni·š
sit.down-amongst-on.the.floor-desiring.to=CAUS=IND.1PL
‘We want you to sit among us.’
(2) ʕ upqswii ʕ aq ƛ nշ uk
ʕ upq-swi·q- ’aq ƛ -nշ uk
flow.through-go.through-inside-in.hand
‘He (grabbed some sand off the beach and) ran it through his fingers.’
In the above examples, each expression constitutes a single
formal unit of one word and yet each expresses a rich mean-
ing that needs to be translated as a sentence in English. Because
of this characteristic, Nuuchahnulth is classified as a polysyn-
thetic language. We will take a deeper look at the nature of the
polysynthesis in Nuuchahnulth below.
```

### STOP AND REFLECT LP5.1 CREATE A GLOSSARY

```
Try making a glossary of all of the morphemes in Examples (1) and (2). That is, make one list of all the roots
in the data, one list of all the suffixes, and one list of all the clitics, together with their glosses. Your glossary
should have ten forms. If you were a linguist just beginning to work on this language, you would start with
such a list and expand it with each new example, noticing when a form already in your glossary is used again,
and so honing your semantic analysis and your understanding of the grammar.
```
```
5.2.3 Word Classes
In many familiar languages, words can be divided into relatively clear word classes, as dis-
cussed in Chapter 5. In modern linguistics, the classification of words is made on the basis
of the kinds of morphophonological processes they undergo (inflection or the ability to take
case-markers) and of the roles they can play in a sentence (e.g., as the predicate or the sub-
ject). The word-class distinction, especially that between noun and verb, is often considered
```

**462 Toshihide Nakayama**

```
universal, that is, a feature that one should expect to find in every human language. When
we examine inflected words that are being used in sentences and utterances, we can find a
similar distinction in Nuuchahnulth. For example, in (3) below, hawiѣþaqšiωuks is function-
ing as a verb, whereas maۊtշii is functioning as a noun. We can determine this on the basis of
the morphosyntactic characteristics of these words: for hawiѣþaqšiωuks the verbal inflection
and the fact that it functions as a predicate; and for maۊtշii the lack of verbal inflection and
its syntactic role as an argument.
hawiѣ č aqšiωuks maۊtշii
hawiѣ- č aq-ši(ω)=uk=s maۊtշii
finish-having.done-PFV=POSS=1SG house
‘I finished making my house.’
```
### (3)

```
Similarly, in (4) haҍicxšiω ʔ iš and ta:kta ʔ i can be character-
ized as a verb and a noun, respectively. Notice that ha ʕ icx-
šiω ʔ iš takes the verbal inflection (the third-person indicative
mood = ʔ i·š ) and functions as the main predicate, and that
ta:kta ʔ i takes nominal inflection (definite = ʔ i· ) and func-
tions as an argument.
```
### SIDEBAR LP5.4

```
The symbol i· , with a “middle dot”
represents a variable-length vowel, where
length is dependent on the context. For
more details, see Exercise 4.
```
**(4)** _ha_ ʕ _icxši_ ƛʔ _iš taakta_ ʔ _i
ha_ ʕ _icx-ši(_ ƛ _)=_ ʔ _i·š taakta=_ ʔi _·_
sneeze-PFV=IND.3 doctor=DEF
‘The doctor sneezed.’
However, while it is possible to classify Nuuchahnulth words into noun and verb on the
basis of their morphosyntactic behavior in sentences, this classification cannot easily be
extended to lexical roots. The difficulty can be illustrated in the following set of examples:

**(5)** _nunuuk_ ʔ _iš_ ɫ _uucma_ ʔ _i
nunuuk=_ ʔ _i·š_ ɫ _uucma=_ ʔ _i·_
singing=IND.3 woman=DEF
‘The woman is singing.’

**(6)** ɫ _uucma_ ʔ _iš nunuuk_ ʔi
ɫ _uucma=_ ʔ _i·_ š _nunuuk=_ ʔi _·_
woman=IND.3 singing=DEF
‘The one who is singing is a woman.’
Above we see that the same root can be put into different functions, either as a verb or as a
noun. The root _nunuuk_ ‘singing’ has a verbal inflection (third-person indicative _=_ ʔ _i·š_ ) and is
functioning as the main predicate in (5), but it has a nominal inflection (definite _=_ ʔ _i·_ ) and
is functioning as an argument in (6). The root ɫ _uucma_ ‘woman,’ on the other hand, shows
the opposite characteristics in the respective examples. To view this from another angle, we
could say that most Nuuchahnulth roots can be part of a verb or a noun. It is therefore not
an obvious task in Nuuchahnulth to classify roots on the basis of the kinds of affixes they
can take or the kinds of roles they can play within a clause.
Because of this difficulty, Nuuchahnulth is sometimes cited as a language without a word-
class distinction. However, that characterization is rather misleading. First, the difficulty is


**463 Language Profile 5 Nuuchahnulth (Nootka)**

```
only related to the classification of lexical roots. As stated before, we can identify verbs and
nouns with respect to words in a sentence. Second, we can see some behavioral classes even
among Nuuchahnulth roots. In particular, there seems to be a relatively clear division between
roots denoting entities and those expressing actions, events, and states. The entity-like roots
are more closely associated with the noun: they occur as nouns frequently and freely, but
their use as verbs is very restricted in terms of frequency and meaning. The opposite is true
for roots expressing actions, events, and states: they can form a verb frequently and without
much restriction, but they must be attached with a definite morpheme to be used as a noun.
Thus, the apparent issue of (the lack of) the word-class distinction in Nuuchahnulth has
to do with the traditional conception of the word-class distinction that often fails to sort
out root-level and word-level classifications.
```
```
5.2.4 Basic Constituent Order
In Nuuchahnulth sentences, the predicate is usually placed first, followed by the subject
and/or the object. The subject is more likely to precede the
object when a speaker produces a sentence out of context – for
example, when translating a sentence from English – but the
order between the two can easily be reversed when speakers are
producing natural, continuous speech.
The initial placement of the predicate is fairly rigid. A nominal
argument (either subject or object) can be placed before the predicate for special emphasis,
but in such cases there is an intonational break separating the preposed argument from the
rest of the sentence.
A noun phrase referring to the subject or object may be omitted when its identity is
already known. In natural discourse (especially in conversation), one would rarely find a
sentence with both the subject and the object overtly mentioned.
```
```
5.2.5 Word Order within NPs
A noun phrase is formed with a nominal head and its modifying elements. It is relatively
rare to have a noun phrase with more than one modifying element in naturally occurring
discourse. When modifiers do co-occur, they appear in a fixed order. To see this, however,
one has to first understand another important aspect of Nuuchahnulth noun phrases.
When suffixes are semantically associated with a noun phrase, they are invariably attached
to the first constituent of the phrase, regardless of the position of the head noun. This is illus-
trated in Examples (7)–(9) below: the lexical suffix -ii ɫ. ‘making’ is attached to the first con-
stituent of the phrase regardless of the position of the noun čʼ apac ‘canoe’ in these examples.
(7) čʼ aapacii ɫ
c ʼ apac-ii ɫ
canoe-making
‘He made a canoe.’
```
### SIDEBAR LP5.5

```
See Textbox 6.10 for more on
constituent ordering in the world’s
languages.
```
```
(8) ƛ u ɫ ii ɫčʼ apac
ƛ u ɫ -ii ɫčʼ apac
nice-making canoe
‘He made a nice canoe.’
```

**464 Toshihide Nakayama**

```
ʔ ii ḥ ii ɫ ƛ u ɫ čʼ apac
ʔ i· ḥ -ii ɫ ƛ u ɫ čʼ apac
greatly-making nice canoe
‘He made a very nice canoe.’
```
### (9)

```
The fact that the suffix -ii ɫ ‘making’ shifts its host in Examples (7)–(9) suggests that it
is associated with the noun phrase as a whole rather than with any individual element
within the phrase. This type of “migratory” attachment pattern is sometimes found with
sentence-level inflectional elements such as mood and person morphemes, but it is uncom-
mon to find such behavior in suffixes with rich lexical content.
Once this fact is understood, it can be seen that the order of noun-phrase elements is
fixed: quantifier/numerals > property concepts > nominal. Examples (10) and (11) illustrate
some complex noun phrases, which were elicited (i.e., speakers produced them as transla-
tions of English sentences). Lexical suffixes are attached to the first element in each case.
```

5.2.6 Complex Meanings Marked by Clause Combinations

```
Clause structure in Nuuchahnulth is comparatively simple. In other languages, a common
grammatical means of introducing complexity into a clause is to use adpositions, which can
introduce locational or temporal noun phrases, or relate additional participants to the main
predicate. For example, in English a basic clause John built the canoe can be expanded with prep-
ositional phrases: John built the canoe with his friends on the beach. Nuuchahnulth does not have
any adpositions, so the expression of such an expanded event description involves the combi-
nation of clauses. In (12) below, the meaning expressed in English by a prepositional phrase,
with the sea lion , is encoded in Nuuchahnulth as a clause tukuuk Ҍukwink ‘being together with the
sea lion’ combined with the main clause tշaapsҌatu qawiqaaѣ ‘Qawiqaalth dove into the water.’
```
**(12)** _[tշaaps_ ʔ _atu qawiqaa_ ɫ _] [tukuuk_ ʔ _ukҭink]
tշaps-_ ʔ _atu qawiqaa_ ɫ _tukuuk_ ʔ _u-kҭink_
dive-sinking. into.water Qawiqaalth sea. lion 3 SG-being. together.with

```
```
The relative order between the negative verb and its complement is fixed: the former
always precedes the latter; the predicate-initial position provides evidence that the word
indicating negation is indeed a verb. Example (15) provides further evidence in that it
demonstrates the ability of the word indicating negation to take verbal morphology, specif-
ically the past-tense marker.

5.3 **Formation of Negation and Questions**

```
The formation of non-declarative sentences, i.e., negation
and questions, involves two different syntactic constructions
in English. Nuuchahnulth also has separate constructions for
negation and question formation, but they are quite different
from those in English.
```
```
5.3.1 Negation
In a Nuuchahnulth negative sentence, negation is expressed through complementation.
A special negative verb serves as the verb of the matrix clause, and the negated content is
expressed as a complement clause. Thus, in (14), the first verb wik ‘not’ expresses negativity
and the complement clause ha ʔ ukši ƛ ‘eat’ expresses the action to be negated. Since English
does not negate sentences this way, it is difficult to come up with a literal translation. It is
something like ‘it is not that he ate,’ although this conveys a strong sense of speaker asser-
tion (compared to ‘he didn’t eat’) that is not part of the semantics of Nuuchahnulth.
```
### SIDEBAR LP5.7

```
See Section 6.4 for examples of
syntactic constructions in English,
and Section 6.5.4 for an explanation
of complementation.
```
```
Again, in (13), what would be expressed in English as a prepositional phrase, for her grand-
children , is expressed in Nuuchahnulth as a combined clause ҌuuҌatup kwakuucuk ‘doing it
for her grandchildren.’
```

**466 Toshihide Nakayama**

5.3.2 Question Formation

```
Polar questions (see Textbox LP5.5) are expressed in Nuuchahnulth with an interrogative
clitic attached to the verb.
```
**(16)** ʔ _uuqۊ_ ɫ _imtۊin_
ʔ _uuqۊ_ ɫ _i=imt=ۊin_
tell.about=PST=Q.1PL
‘Did we tell about it?’

**(17)** _mamuukۊ
mamuuk=ۊ_
work=Q.3
‘Is he working?’

```
It is also very common, especially with the second-person subject, to express polar ques-
tions using only a rising intonation contour, without the interrogative marker.
```
**(18)** _hawշiiq_ ƛ _k
hawշiiq_ ƛ _=k_
hungry=2SG
‘Are you hungry?’

**(19)** _ۊawշi_ ɫ _k_.
_ۊawշi_ ɫ _=k_
wealthy/chief=2SG
‘Are you wealthy?; Are you a chief?’

```
Content questions , on the other hand, can be expressed – like negation – with a comple-
ment construction where the question word functions as the verb of the matrix clause. The
event or state with respect to which the question is asked is expressed either with a lexical
suffix or with a complement clause. The main predicate built around the question word can
carry the interrogative clitic, although the predicate without the clitic is also very common.
There are thus a variety of possible strategies for this function, and they can combine to
produce a range of related constructions, as illustrated in the following examples.
```
### TEXTBOX LP5.5 POLAR VERSUS CONTENT QUESTIONS

```
There are two types of questions in the world’s
languages: polar questions (discussed in Section
6.4), which can be answered with a simple “yes” or
“no” response, and content questions (sometimes
called wh-questions), which query a specific piece
of information. Thus, in English the question “Did
```
```
you finish the ice cream?” is a polar question
and can be answered with a simple affirmative
or negative response, while “When will you
buy more?” is a content question, as it requests
that the interlocutor supply a specific piece of
information.
```

```
```
5.3.3 Nuuchahnulth Morphology and Polysynthesis
In this section we will take a detailed look at the complex word formation in Nuuchahnulth.
As mentioned above (see Examples 1 and 2 ), what sets Nuuchahnulth word formation apart
from that in familiar languages like English are the facts that it allows (a) the packing
of complex meanings within a word through the combination of many morphemes and
(b) for a single word to contain all the information necessary to
serve as an independent sentence. This type of word formation
is known as polysynthesis.
Polysynthesis in Nuuchahnulth is based on the affixation
of lexical suffixes. The lexical suffix is a cross-linguistically
unusual type of affix in that it expresses a concrete lexical
meaning rather than an abstract grammatical function, and
in that the inventory is large. (There are between 400 and 500 suffixes of this type in
Nuuchahnulth.) Despite their semantic richness, lexical suffixes are purely dependent
elements morphologically: they must always be attached to some stem and can never
stand alone to form a word.
The meanings expressed by lexical suffixes span across a wide range (see, e.g., Textbox
LP5.6). The following is a sample list of lexical suffixes:
```
### SIDEBAR LP5.8

```
Polysynthesis is introduced in Section
4.8; see also the Language Profiles
on South Conchucos Quechua (LP6)
and Seneca (LP13).
```

**468 Toshihide Nakayama**

```
The semantic range of lexical suffixes overlaps with that of roots, but there are some
notable differences between the two. Locative concepts are almost exclusively expressed
by lexical suffixes. In contrast, nominal concepts (entities) are predominantly expressed
by roots. Although there are lexical suffixes expressing nominal concepts, the meanings
expressed are limited to conventionalized, generic notions.
In most cases there is no clear etymological link between a lexical suffix and a root. There
are a few pairs of lexical suffixes and roots that do share a similar form and meaning, e.g.,
the verb root wa· ‘say’ and the lexical suffix - wa · ‘say,’ but they are very limited exceptions.
Lexical suffixes, because of their rich semantics, play a significant role in shaping the
semantic and syntactic characteristics of the word. Particularly interesting are those that
```
### TEXTBOX LP5.6 LEXICAL SUFFIXES FOR FEASTING

```
Lexical suffixes express conventionalized actions and
concepts that are highly entrenched in everyday life.
Consequently, the inventory of lexical suffixes can tell
us something about the everyday life of the people
who have been using the language. For example,
feasting and the gift-giving festival known as a potlatch
are central rituals in Nuuchahnulth culture (and
```
```
indeed in many indigenous communities of the Pacific
Northwest Coast). It may at first look curious to the
outsider to find suffixes like - ’in ɫ ‘giving feast of ...,
distributing ... in feast,’ - ’imcu ‘feasting, entertaining,’
or - tuu ɫ a ‘potlatch for,’ but this shows how important
potlatch and feast-giving are in Nuuchahnulth culture
and social life.
```
```

```

čތ apac-( č )ii ɫ
canoe-make
‘make a canoe’
The nominal root is the head: it is an independent morpheme and it serves as the base
of word formation. The lexical suffix, on the other hand, is a bound morpheme that needs
to be attached to the base, thus making it dependent on the root. However, this depend-
ency relationship seems to be reversed semantically. The verbal lexical suffix determines
the basic meaning of the word, whereas the nominal root is supplementing the meaning
expressed by the lexical suffix. Thus, this word formation is an interesting case of a mis-
match between the morphological relationship and the semantic relationship. (25) is an
additional example.
```
```
(25) kշi ɫ at ʕ in ɫʔ aq ƛ s
kշi ɫ atq-’in ɫ = ʔ aq ƛ =s
hairseal-giving.a.feast.of=FUT= 1 SG
root   lexical suffix
‘I will give a feast of hair seal; I will serve hair seal at a feast.’
```
```
5.3.4 Functions of Polysynthetic Words in Discourse
Thanks to the unusually powerful word-formation mechanism involving lexical suffixes,
a word in Nuuchahnulth can encode a meaning as rich as that of a multi-word English
sentence. Thus, the same information can sometimes be encoded either morphologically or
syntactically. In the following examples, the participant child is expressed as a root with a
lexical suffix in one case (26) but as a separate independent word in another (27).
```
```
(26) tշaatnշanakši ƛʔ a ƛ quuk
tշaatnշa-na·k-ši( ƛ )=’a ƛ =quuk
child.PL-having-PFV=EVENT=COND.2SG
‘when you have children’
```
### (24)

```
(27) ʔ unaak ʔ a ɫ tշaatnշa.
ʔ u-na·k= ʔ a· ɫ tշaatnշa
3 SG-having=PL child.PL
‘They had children.’
This flexibility raises an interesting question: Why does the speaker choose one strategy
of encoding over the other? The choice has to do with whether the speaker is referring to
a particular person or entity. The compact expression generally expresses habitual, institu-
tionalized activities rather than particular ones. For example, the predicate in (26) expresses
the general activity of having children rather than a particular activity bound in time and
```
```
become the semantic head of the word (i.e., convey the word’s primary semantic content).
In Example (24) a verbal lexical suffix -(c)iiѣ ‘make’ is attached to a nominal root čތ apac
‘canoe’ to form a word ‘to make a canoe.’
```

**470 Toshihide Nakayama**

```
In (29a) ҍuyշi ‘medicine’ is part of the general activity of medicine-taking and therefore does
not refer to a particular medicine. In contrast, ҍuyշi in (29b) does refer to a particular medi-
cine owned by Mink, as indicated by the possessive and definite suffixes.
Lexical suffixation and compounding in languages like English show a great deal of func-
tional similarity in this aspect, although these two processes are very different in structural
terms. Compare the above examples with morphological complexes like berry-picking and
bird-watching in relation to pick the berry and watch the bird. The compact expression is only
possible when the nominal does not refer to a specific entity.
```
```
6 months hi ɫ pࡑ a č iina čތ apac ʔ usiik
hi ɫ pࡑ aa č iina čތ apac ʔ u-siik
six.months be.there pachina canoe 3 SG-completing
‘For six months, I was at Pachina completing the canoe.’
Sentence (28a) was produced at the beginning of a narrative in which the speaker
explained how canoes used to be built. Here the root čތ apac ‘canoe’ does not refer to a par-
ticular entity: the notion of canoe is part of a generic action of canoe-making. In (28b), on
the other hand, the same root čތ apac is used referentially to make reference to a particular
canoe that the speaker was requested to build, and it is expressed in a word separate from
the verbal element.
A similar contrast is observed in (a) and (b) of example (29) (the parts of the trans-
lation in square brackets present information known from the broader discourse
context):
```
**(29) a.** ʕ _uy_ ’ _·ii_ cࡑ _apշat hitaaq_ ƛ _շi_ ƛ.

```
ʕ uy ’ ·i-’ i·c =’ap=’at hita-’a·q ƛތ i( ƛ )
medicine-consuming=CAUS=PASS get.there-being.in.the.woods
‘They had me take medicine in the woods [SO that I could have sons].’
```
```
b. sukҭi ʔ a ƛʕ uy ’ ·aak ʔ i
sukҭi( ƛ )=’a ƛʕ uy ’ ·i= ʔ a·k= ʔ i·
take=EVENT medicine=POSS=DEF
‘He [Mink] took out his medicine [to create a lake].’
```
```
b.
```
```
place (e.g., having a particular child). Thus, a nominal element combined with a lexical
suffix within a complex word, like tތ aa nތ a ‘children’ in (26), is not referential in discourse
(i.e., not used for introducing a referent into a discourse that will subsequently be discussed
or “tracked” as an activated referent; see Textbox 9.3 for a description of referent tracking).
In contrast, when the speaker refers to a particular entity (e.g., the children in (27)), the
nominal and verbal elements are expressed as separate words. Observe the contrast between
(a) and (b) in Example (28).
```
**(28) a.** čތ _aapacii_ ɫwތitʼ _as_.
čތ _apac-ii_ ɫ _-_ wތitʼ _as_

### CHAPTER SUMMARY

```
Although highly endangered, Nuuchahnulth is a rich language with many interesting
typological features. These include a large consonant inventory with extensive
glottalization, an absence of a distinction between nouns and verbs for lexical roots,
predicate-initial constituent order, and the use of clause combinations to express complex
meanings.
Particularly striking is the polysynthetic word formation and the extensive inventory of
lexical suffixes. Polysynthesis complicates our cross-linguistic understanding of the nature
of words. Languages of this type show that the layout of the major domains of structural
formation (i.e., word-level structure versus clause-level structure) can differ significantly
across languages.

### EXERCISES

**1. Perfective aspect allomorphs**
    The perfective aspect suffix _-ši_ ƛ in Nuuchahnulth has three allomorphs,
    _-ši_ ƛ _ ~ -_ č _i_ ƛ _~ -kҭi_ ƛ. This problem will focus on the allomorphs _-ši_ ƛ _and -_ č _i_ ƛ.
    (This alternation is represented in the top line of the transcription.)
    Compare the phonological environments in which each occurs. Determine
    the distribution pattern of these two allomorphs and write a clear statement
    about the conditions under which each appears.

**4. Variable-length vowels**
    Nuuchahnulth has so-called variable-length vowels that are realized as long vowels in some contexts
    and as short vowels in others. _Note_ : variable-length vowels are indicated by a “middle dot,” i.e., /V·/
    where V stands for any vowel letter, in the morphemic (second) line of each example.
       Compare the forms in the text (top) line and those in the morphemic (second) line to see whether the variable-
    length vowel is pronounced as long (as in (a)) or short (as in (b)). Formulate a statement that distinctly states the
    conditions under which a variable-length vowel will be realized as short and realized as long.
       ( _Hint_ : Notice that the same morpheme [e.g., _-a·s_ ‘on a board/platform’] is sometimes pronounced
    with a long vowel and sometimes with a short vowel. What does this tell you about where to look for the
    conditions that trigger the rule?)

**5. Change-inducing suffixes**
    Some of the suffixes in Nuuchahnulth cause various changes in the shape of the root. For each of the
    examples below, compare the underlying (second line) and combined (top line) shapes of each root and
    note any changes that have occurred (don’t worry about changes in the suffixes themselves). Make a list
    of the suffixes that do instigate changes and those that do not. For those that do, state the phonological
    change that the root undergoes.

**LANGUAGE PROFILE 6**

South Conchucos Quechua

6.1 **Introduction**

```
The South Conchucos Quechua language is spoken in the Andes mountains of central Peru.
The name Quechua derives from the native word * qit ʂ wa meaning ‘temperate zone,’ which
translates to an elevation ranging from 9,000 to 13,000 feet. South Conchucos Quechua
villages are traditionally located on steep, rugged slopes at these lofty altitudes.
```
6.1.1 Genetic Affiliation

```
South Conchucos Quechua is a member of the Quechua language family. These languages,
native to western South America, developed long before the Inca Empire was established
(Torero 1964: 477). According to the Ethnologue , forty-four varieties of Quechua are cur-
rently spoken by over 9 million people throughout much of the Andean highlands and to
a lesser extent in the Amazonian lowlands (Lewis et al. 2016).
Torero locates the Quechua homeland along the coast and mountains of central Peru.
From a linguistic point of view, this region is heavily fragmented, with “no full mutual
intelligibility between the different dialects” (Adelaar 2006: 121). Twenty modern vari-
eties, including South Conchucos Quechua, are spoken in this “Central Quechua”
region, which is roughly a fifth of the size of California or twice the size of Switzerland
(see Figure LP6.2). The other shaded areas correspond to all other Quechuan varieties
extending north and south of the original Central Quechua homeland. The distance
between where Inga Quechua (Colombia) and Santiago del Estero Quechua (Argentina)
are spoken is approximately 2,160 miles, which is nearly the distance from Los Angeles
to Washington, DC.
```
6.1.2 Location and Size of Speech Community

```
South Conchucos Quechua is spoken by approximately 250,000 people in the eastern
Ancash and western Huánuco regions of central Peru (see Figure LP6.3). This area is
bounded on the west by the glacier-covered Cordillera Blanca, with many peaks towering
over 20,000 feet. The South Conchucos Quechua language area extends northeastward
across the Marañón River gorge. Some large communities have up to 3,000 residents, but
the vast majority of people live in smaller settlements scattered across this remote Andean

```
region. Major population centers include Huari, Chavín de Huantar, Llamellín, San Luis,
and Huacaybamba.
```
6.1.3 Language Viability, Society, and Culture

```
Traditional Andean agricultural practices are the norm in the communities of South
Conchucos. Small fields etched into rugged slopes produce pota-
toes ( papa ), corn ( hara ), wheat ( tri:gu ), beans ( tawri, a:ba ), and
other crops. Families typically own one or more cows ( wa:ka )
and donkeys ( ashnu ), and raise a few pigs ( kuchi ), chickens
( wallpa ), and guinea pigs ( haka ), as well as sheep ( u:sha ) for wool.
The community-based production of alpaca wool sold to the
national government is a recent innovation.
South Conchucos Quechua speakers are not shy about their
language. Quechua is the language of everyday life for people
of all ages, the language of understanding and connection. A
small percentage of the population are monolingual Quechua
speakers, who are generally older women and men, as well
as preschool children. Most adults and school-age children

can also communicate to varying degrees in the local variety of Spanish, but there is a
definite preference for Quechua. Children play together in Quechua. School teachers
often speak and joke around in Quechua. In fact, people almost always speak among
themselves in Quechua, but switch to Spanish to accommodate outsiders.
Native-authored literature is another recent innovation. There are over one hundred titles
published in South Conchucos Quechua, including books of traditional stories, songs, rid-
dles, a health manual, literacy materials, a translation of the novel Heidi , and a translation
of the New Testament. Thousands have learned to read in their native language through
community-based literacy efforts.

```
```
6.2.3 Word Formation
South Conchucos Quechua is a polysynthetic language, that is, words are formed by
combining several morphemes together. Words typically consist of a single root plus
a sequence of suffixes and enclitics. There are a total of 95
suffixes: 64 used in verbs and 31 used in nouns (or pronouns).
In addition, 19 enclitics are common to both verbs and nouns.
There are no prefixes.
This language is also agglutinative. In other words,
most suffixes and enclitics express a single component of
meaning and generally do not change form across mor-
pheme boundaries (though final vowels may change). This
agglutinative tendency makes South Conchucos Quechua
words relatively easy to divide into individual morphemes.
(A list of all the bound morphemes used in the examples,
together with their glosses, can be found at the end of this
language profile.)

```
The kuka (coca) plant is native to the highlands
of western South America. Its pungent leaves are
traditionally chewed with lime powder (calcium
hydroxide) to increase the release of alkaloids. Coca
serves as a stimulant to overcome fatigue, hunger,
```
```
thirst, and altitude sickness. It is also used as an
anesthetic. Coca has been a vital part of the religious
cosmology of Andean people from the pre-Inca period
through the present. Extract of coca leaves has been
cited as an ingredient in the original Coca-Cola recipe.
```
```
Sun-dried coca leaves
```
**(1)** _haka-n-kuna-pa: apa-ra-mu-sha_
guinea.pig-3-PL-PURP take-BRIEF-TO-PST
‘She brought (food) for her guinea pigs.’


**483 Language Profile 6 South Conchucos Quechua**

```
The first word is the noun hakankunapa :, which means ‘for her guinea pigs.’ This word
begins with the noun root haka ‘guinea pig’ followed by three noun suffixes. The first
suffix -n marks third-person possessive ‘her,’ followed by - kuna ‘noun plural’ and - pa :
‘purpose.’
The second word in (1) is the verb aparamusha , which means ‘she brought it.’ This word
consists of the verb root apa - ‘take’ followed by three verbal suffixes. The first suffix - ra
reports the brief duration of the event. The suffix - mu shifts the meaning from ‘take (there)’
to ‘bring (here).’ The suffix - sha indicates a past event. We will explore South Conchucos
Quechua verb formation in greater detail in Section LP6.3 below.
```
```
6.2.4 Possession in Nouns
Four suffixes are used to indicate possession in nouns. First-person possessive is marked
by the suffix -: , that is, the final vowel of the noun stem is lengthened ( haka ‘guinea pig’
versus haka: ‘my guinea pig’). Second-person possessive is marked by the suffix - yki. As we
saw in (1), third-person possessive is marked by the suffix - n. South Conchucos Quechua
has an additional possessive suffix, - ntsik , which marks first-person inclusive, meaning
‘yours and mine.’
```
```

6.2.5 Word Order within Clauses
A main clause consists of a verb, plus an optional subject noun phrase, an optional
object noun phrase, and various other optional elements. In English the subject (S), verb
(V), and object (O) most often occur in the order S-V-O, where the subject precedes the
verb and the verb precedes the object. By contrast, the order of these elements in South
Conchucos Quechua is relatively free. A study by Diane Hintz (2003) found that fewer than
7 percent of main clauses in connected speech have both subject and object noun phrases
expressed. In those that do, no single order is significantly more frequent than others.
Examples of the two most frequent orders, S-O-V (35 percent) and S-V-O (32 percent), are
given in (3) and (4). Though S most frequently occurs in the clause-initial position, prag-
matic factors also motivate S in the clause-final position.

### TEXTBOX LP6.4 WHERE DOES THE POTATO COME FROM?

```
Potatoes are native to the highlands of South America
where they have been consumed for more than 8,000
years. Spanish explorers brought the plant to Europe
in the late sixteenth century. The International Potato
Center, headquartered in Peru, seeks to reduce poverty
```
```
and achieve sustainable food security in developing
countries.
The English word potato derives from Spanish patata.
According to the Spanish Royal Academy, patata
derives from a combination of Quechua papa ‘potato’
and Taino batata ‘sweet potato.’

Although word order is variable in main clauses, adverbial clauses are almost always
verb-final. The main clause in (5) is Wachullash aywakusha ‘Lorenzo went up there.’ The
final three words (within brackets) constitute an adverbial clause.

```
```
The two-word object tsay chi:nata ‘that girl’ is followed by the verb aparkur ‘taking along.’
Two types of adverbial clauses in South Conchucos Quechua are described in Textbox LP6.5.
```
### TEXTBOX LP6.5 ADVERBIAL CLAUSE TYPES

```
South Conchucos Quechua has two primary types of
adverbial clauses, each marked by a different suffix.
The adverbial suffix - r is illustrated in examples (5),
(13), and (14), and in Exercise (5). It indicates that the
subject of the adverbial clause is coreferential with the
subject of the main clause (the main clause can either
precede or follow the adverbial clause). It is glossed
```
```
ADV.SS for ‘same subject.’ The adverbial suffix - pti is
illustrated in (10) and in Exercise (1). It indicates that
the subject of the adverbial clause is not coreferential
with the subject of the main clause, so is glossed ADV.DS
for ‘different subject.’ This type of system is called
switch reference ; see also the Manambu Language
Profile, Section P 10.2.8.
```
```
6.2.6 Case and Grammatical Relations
The association between a noun (or pronoun) and a verb is referred to as a grammati-
cal relation. Core grammatical relations in South Conchucos Quechua are subjects and
objects. As seen above in (3)–(5), objects are marked by the case suffix - ta (e.g., shinqirutam,
kuruta, chi:nata ). Subjects, on the other hand, are marked by the
absence of any case suffix (e.g., Mariapis, noqa, Wachullash ).
At least fifteen additional case suffixes mark non-core, or
peripheral, grammatical relations, also known as obliques. For
example, in (1), the case suffix - pa: marks ‘purpose’ in the word
haka-n-kuna-pa: ‘for her guinea pigs.’ Other obliques include
-cho:/-chu ‘location,’ - man ‘toward,’ - pita ‘from,’ - no:/ - nuy ‘like,’
and - yaq ‘until.’
```
```
6.2.7 Evidentials
South Conchucos Quechua has a small, yet very important,
set of six word-final enclitics that report the speaker’s source of
information and the degree of certainty the speaker holds toward
that information. These enclitics are known as evidentials.
They can attach to almost any word, but their use is generally
restricted to only one per sentence. The most frequent eviden-
tials in everyday speech are = mi , = chir , and = cha:. The least fre-
quent are = chi , = shi , and = ran.
```
### SIDEBAR LP6.6

```
Evidentials are also found in
Manange (Section LP3.2.2) and Tsez
(Section LP7.3.1); they are noted
as a linguistic feature of the Vaupés
River Basin of Brazil and Colombia in
Section 13.6.

**486 Daniel J. Hintz**

```
We have seen examples of = mi (or = m ) in the words shinqirutam in (3) and wanutsi:mi in
(4). This enclitic means ‘I affirm ... ’ Affirmative = mi reports information that the individ-
ual speaker has acquired personally and is willing to endorse. In contrast, the reportative
enclitic = shi (or = sh ), illustrated in Wachullash in (5), reports second-hand information that
the speaker does not necessarily endorse. = shi adds the sense ‘They say ... ’ The conjectural
enclitic = chi reports information acquired via deduction, meaning ‘I suppose ... ’

**(6)** _atska wa:ka_ = _chi pe sha-ya:-mu-n_ = _si_

‘Many cows also came along (I suppose).’
Evidential enclitics in this language also express contrasts along the interpersonal dimen-
sion. For example, individual knowledge reported by = _mi_ contrasts with mutual knowledge
reported by = _cha:_ , which could be translated as ‘We (inclusive) all know ... ’

**(7)** _tsay-pa=cha: qati-ya-ra-n mama-yki-kuna_
that-GEN=MUTUAL follow-PL-PST-3 mother-2-PL
‘In that place your mothers [your ancestors] pastured animals (as we all know).’

6.3 **Verb Formation**

```
A total of sixty-four suffixes and nineteen enclitics are used in the formation of South
Conchucos Quechua verbs. Normally, a verb root must have at least one suffix to mark the
person of the subject. The actual number of verbal suffixes and enclitics tends to range from
three to six in a given verb, though eight to ten is not uncommon.
A simplified view of South Conchucos Quechua verb structure is presented in Table LP6.2.
The verb root is followed by a sequence of suffixes and enclitics. A set of six OPTIONAL suffix
slots is followed by three OBLIGATORY suffix slots, and finally the ENCLITIC slots. The enclitics
can attach to either verbs or nouns.
In Table LP6.2, the verb shoqatsimaruykicha: is divided into its individual morphemes.
The verb root shoqa - ‘comfort’ is followed by one suffix or enclitic in each general position
of the verb. The causative suffix - tsi fills one of the OPTIONAL slots. This is followed by the
suffixes - ma: (allomorph - ma ) ‘first-person object,’ - ru ‘past tense,’ and - yki ‘second-person
subject’ in the three OBLIGATORY slots. The final verbal element, the evidential enclitic = cha:
‘mutual knowledge,’ fills an ENCLITIC slot. We will now examine some of these verb slots in
more detail.

```
6.3.1 Subject Slot
As shown in Table LP6.2, the OBLIGATORY slot set consists of the TENSE-DEVERBAL slot, preceded
by the OBJECT and followed by the SUBJECT. The subject in present tense is specified by one
of four suffixes. First-person subjects are marked by the suffix -: , which lengthens the final
vowel of the verb stem. Second person is marked by the suffix - nki and third person by the
suffix - n. The suffix - ntsik marks first-person inclusive, meaning ‘you and I.’
```
```
(8) Subject suffixes in present tense
rika - ‘see’
-: ‘1’ rika-: ‘I see’
```
- _nki_ ‘2’ _rika-nki_ ‘you see’
- _n_ ‘3’ _rika-n_ ‘s/he sees’
- _ntsik_ ‘1.INCL, first person inclusive’ _rika-ntsik_ ‘we see’ (you and I)

```
The suffixes in (8) also mark the person of the subject in past tense, with the exception of
second person, which is marked by - yki rather than - nki ( rika-nki ‘you see’ versus rika-ra-yki
‘you saw’).
```
```
6.3.2 Tense-Deverbal Slot
The TENSE-DEVERBAL slot can be filled by any one of twenty-seven different suffixes. Nearly
half of these indicate tense , or the location of an event in time. Present tense is marked by
the absence of an overt suffix in the TENSE-DEVERBAL slot, as illustrated in (8) and (10). South
Conchucos Quechua also has five past-tense suffixes: - sha in (1), (5), (11), and (14), - ru in
(Table LP6.2) and (13), - na: ‘narrative past,’ - ra in (7), and - q in Exercise (4).
Why does South Conchucos Quechua have so many past-tense suffixes? We can answer
this question by examining how each is used in connected speech. For example, either - ru
or - ra can report a past event, whether it took place recently or many years ago. The contrast
is that events marked by - ru are usually more recent than events marked by - ra. In other
words, recent past - ru and remote past - ra specify relative degrees of pastness.
Surprisingly, recent past - ru is used only with first-person, second-person, and first-person
inclusive referents. Recent past in third person is marked by the suffix - sha instead.
Habitual past - q in Exercise (4) reports a situation that is customarily repeated in the past.
In contrast, the past-tense suffixes - ra , - ru , and - sha report past situations that are not ongo-
ing, but bounded in the past.
The past-tense suffixes - ru and - ra are followed by a separate suffix that marks the subject.
In contrast, each suffix in (9) marks both future tense and the person of the subject, rather
than marking these with two separate suffixes. (Textbox LP6.6 gives an example sentence
using the suffix - shayki .)
```
```
(9) Future-tense suffixes
rika - ‘see’
```
- _sha:_ ‘1.FUT’ _rika_ - _sha:_ ‘I will see’
- _nki_ ‘2.FUT’ _rika_ - _nki_ ‘you will see’
- _nqa_ ‘3.FUT’ _rika_ - _nqa_ ‘s/he will see’


**488 Daniel J. Hintz**

- _shun_ ‘1.INCL.FUT’ _rika_ - _shun_ ‘we will see’ (you and I)
- _shayki_ ‘FUT1>2, first-person subject with
    second-person object’

```
rika - shayki ‘I will see you’
```
```
Some suffixes that fill the TENSE-DEVERBAL slot produce an adverbial clause and have a spe-
cial function of specifying its subject. The adverbial suffix - r , illustrated in (5), indicates that
the subject of the adverbial clause is the same as the subject of the main clause. In contrast,
```
- _pti_ indicates that the subjects of the two clauses are different. For example, the subject of
the main clause in (10) is _mamantsik_ ‘our mother’ and the subject of the adverbial clause is
first person ‘I.’ Because the two subjects are different, the speaker uses the adverbial suffix
- _pti_ in the tense-deverbal slot of the verb _shakamupti:pis_ (in brackets).

### TEXTBOX LP6.6 ONE SUFFIX, THREE COMPONENTS OF MEANING

```
The suffix - shayki conveys three components of meaning. It marks not only future tense and first-person subject,
but also second-person object:
tsay-kaq-ta=ra: willa-yku-shayki=qa
that-DEF-OBJ=YET tell-OBLIGATE-FUT1>2=TOP
‘I will tell you about that.’
```
**(10)** _mama-ntsik waqa-n feyupa_ [ _sha-ka-mu-pti-:=pis_ ]
mother-1.INCL cry-3 much come-MIDDLE-TO-ADV.DS-1=EVEN
‘Our mother cries a lot, even though I come home often.’

```
Based on what you have learned so far, determine the South Conchucos Quechua forms for ‘s/he recently
slept,’ ‘I sleep,’ ‘you will sleep,’ and ‘we (inclusive) recently slept.’ Check your answers in Sidebar LP6.9.
```
6.3.3 Optional Verb Slots

```
Twenty-eight additional suffixes may fill the six OPTIONAL slots close to the verb root.
Speakers use these suffixes to express a variety of functions not available in the OBLIGATORY
slots discussed above. We will now examine suffixes that adjust
transitivity and express social functions.
First, certain suffixes affect the transitivity of a verb by
increasing or decreasing the number of arguments it controls.
For example, the verb root wanu - ‘die’ normally takes only
one argument: the subject. When the causative suffix - tsi is
added, however, the resulting verb stem wanu - tsi - ‘kill’ takes two
```

morphemes in other languages,

```
arguments: a subject and an object. The transitivity has been changed from intransitive to
transitive.
```
```
(11)
```
### SIDEBAR LP6.8

```
Since both the causative and passive
suffixes result in adjustments to the broader
grammatical structure of the clause, we can
say that South Conchucos Quechua has
causative and passive constructions (see
Chapter 6, Section 6.4).
```
```
wanu-sha ‘she died’
wanu-tsi-sha ‘he killed her’ (caused her to die)
```
```
The passive suffix - ka: (allomorph - ka ) also changes the
transitivity. The verb root rura - ‘do’ normally can take two
arguments: a subject and an object. When the passive suf-
fix - ka is added, the resulting verb stem controls only one
argument: the subject. The transitivity has been changed
from transitive to intransitive.
```
**(12)** (^) _rura-n_ ‘he does it’
_rura-ka-n_ ‘it happens’
Other suffixes in the optional verbal slots systematically express social functions, such
as **stance**. For example, in (13) the suffix - _rku_ indicates both parties’ willingness to stay
together by mutual consent. The stances of the participants converge. By contrast, in (14)
the suffix - _yku_ (allomorph - _yka_ ) conveys the unwillingness of the children to be put to sleep
by their mother. The stances of the participants diverge.
**(13)** _ta:ra-ya-ru-: ishke: tsakay punu-rku-r=yan_
stay-PL-PST-1 two night sleep-CONSENT-ADV.SS=DISTR
‘We stayed together, sleeping there for two nights.’
**(14)** _rantiku-sha wamra-n-kuna-ta punu-yka-tsi-r_
sell-PST child-3-PL-OBJ sleep-OBLIGATE-CAUS-ADV.SS
‘She sold (drinks) after putting her unwilling children to sleep.’
The South Conchucos Quechua language is beautiful and
complex, a reflection of shared concepts distilled through gen-
erations of human experience. Language documentation makes
these ideas accessible to others and helps motivate the speech
community to increasingly value their language and to pass it
on to future generations.

**LANGUAGE PROFILE 7**

Tsez

7.1 **Introduction**

```
Tsez, also known as Dido, is spoken in the North Caucasus, more specifically in the Republic
of Daghestan (also spelled Dagestan), the southernmost constituent republic of the Russian
Federation. Tsez is spoken by about 12,500 people, according to the 2010 census of the
Russian Federation. Most speakers of Tsez live in their traditional territory in western
Daghestan, against the main range of the Caucasus mountains and close to the frontier
with the Republic of Georgia. (“Dido” is, incidentally, the Georgian name for the Tsez.)
However, a substantial number, perhaps about 45 percent, have migrated to lowland areas
of Daghestan. In the traditional territory, Tsez is the usual language of spoken communica-
tion and is acquired as a first language by all children. As such, the language is not currently
endangered, although there are some recent changes that could jeopardize its status in the
not too distant future: the frontier between Russia and Georgia has been increasingly mil-
itarized, and the traditional Tsez area is now home to a military presence whose members
either are native speakers of Russian or use Russian as their lingua franca and who neither
know nor can be expected to learn Tsez.
Tsez is one of five languages belonging to the Tsezic group of languages, which also
includes Khwarshi, Hinuq (Ginukh), Bezhta, and Hunzib (Gunzib). The languages are about
as distinct from one another as the Germanic languages, so that speakers of one Tsezic lan-
guage can easily recognize individual words in another – the word for ‘girl,’ for instance, is
kid in both Tzez and Bezhta, just as ‘hand’ is hand in both English and German. However,
as with Germanic languages, speakers of one language have to take the trouble to learn
another if they want to speak it fully and not just recognize individual words. The Tsezic
group of languages in turn is part of a larger language family called Nakh-Daghestanian
(also called East Caucasian or Northeast Caucasian), which includes most but not all of the
indigenous languages of Daghestan. (For example, Kumyk, a major language of the Caspian
seaboard, is a Turkic language.) Some Nakh-Daghestanian languages are also spoken in
northern Azerbaijan as well as further to the west. These include Chechen and Ingush,
which are spoken in the like-named republics of the Russian Federation, as well as Tsova
Tush (also called Bats and Batsbi). The latter is an endangered language spoken by per-
haps 3,000 speakers in Georgia and is undergoing rapid linguistic assimilation to Georgian.

The internal diversification of the Nakh-Daghestanian family is
comparable to that of Indo-European, despite the much smaller
area it covers and its much smaller number of languages and
speakers.
The North Caucasus is an area of extreme linguistic diver-
sification. The Nakh-Daghestanian family includes both large
(by local standards) languages like Chechen, with well over a
million speakers, and Avar, with over 700,000 speakers, as well
as some smaller languages. Some of these smaller languages
have even fewer speakers than Tsez (e.g., Hinuq is the language
of a single village, with about 600 speakers). As a general rule,
the larger languages are characterized by exogamic marriage practices, that is, members
of these speech communities are encouraged not to marry close relatives, which over
time has probably led to the assimilation of smaller speech communities and the devel-
opment of larger ones. The smaller languages are characterized by endogamic marriage
practices, that is, members of the speech community are encouraged to marry within a
very restricted geographical area and kinship network, including, for instance, cousins.
In general, endogamic practices characterize the more mountainous areas, but the small
speech communities should not be seen as a direct result of the difficulties in population

```
movement caused by mountainous terrain – in New Guinea,
for instance, it is precisely in the Highlands that the larger
speech communities are found. Rather, endogamy is a response
to the shortage of agricultural land in the mountains and the
fear that marriage to outsiders might give the latter rights to
this scarce land.
Tsez is basically an unwritten language. Avar, a distant relative within the Nakh-
Daghestanian language family, is the traditional lingua franca of western Daghestan,
including the area where the Tsezic languages are spoken. More recently, however, Russian
has encroached on this role, not least because it is the language of instruction in local
schools (and more recently of television), although Avar is still taught as a school subject.
In general, those who grow up in the traditional Tsez-speaking area speak Tsez, Avar, and
Russian, though younger people usually feel more at home with Russian as their primary
non-native language, and older speakers with Avar. There is no standard Tsez language;
each village has its own dialect. However, there is rarely any difficulty for inhabitants of
one village to understand those of another, with the possible exception of the dialect of
the village of Sagada (Tsez: Soƛ ’ o), the most divergent Tsez dialect. Tsez speakers speak the
dialect of their home village, and there is no single prestigious variety that other speakers
assimilate to. The dialectal diversification of the language can be seen as another effect of
endogamy, strengthening relations within the village and setting each village apart from
its neighbors.
As might be expected from the status of Avar as a lingua franca, Tsez has borrowed a lot of
vocabulary from Avar, including many vocabulary items that ultimately come from Persian,
Turkic languages, or Arabic. (The Tsez, like most populations of Daghestan and the North
Caucasus more generally, are Muslims, in contrast to the Christian Georgians across the
main range of the Caucasus.) Although the frontier with Georgia is now closed, there was
regular contact across the main range of the Caucasus going back at least two millennia.
Not surprisingly, Tsez also has some loanwords from Georgian, mainly words denoting con-
crete items that were also acquired initially from Georgia, such as certain foodstuffs, agri-
cultural implements, and elements of house building and furnishing. Nowadays, Russian is
the main source of loanwords referring to aspects of the modern world.

7.2 Phonology
Although phonetics and phonology is not the main thrust of this chapter, it will be neces-
sary to explain some of the unusual properties of the Tsez phoneme inventory, especially as
it relates to consonants, so that the examples can be appreciated not only morphologically
and syntactically, but also phonetically and phonologically.
All Tsez dialects have five short vowels, indeed the usual set of five vowels that is the sin-
gle most frequent vowel inventory across the languages of the world. Different dialects have
differing numbers of long vowels, though the Asakh (Tsez: asaq) dialect of the village of
Tesbari (Tsez: ceboru), on which this chapter is based, has one long vowel. (Orthographically,
this is represented as [Ɨ], rather than IPA [aː].) See Table LP7.1.
```
### SIDEBAR LP7.2

```
For an explanation of the term
lingua franca, see Section 15.2.1.
```

**498 Bernard Comrie**

```
The consonant system, by contrast, is very rich (as in other languages of the region; see
Textbox LP7.1). The symbols are in general those of the International Phonetic Alphabet,
although [š, ž] are used to indicate the palato-alveolar fricatives [ʃ, ʒ], [y] is used rather than
[j] for the palatal glide, and the symbols [x] and [ɣ] (rather than [χ] and [ʁ]) are used for
the uvular fricatives. For the affricates, which are very frequent in Tsez, the IPA digraphs
(two-character symbols) have been abandoned in favor of the symbols [c] for dental, [ƛ] for
lateral (see below), and [þ] for palatal. See Table LP7.2.
Like many languages spoken in the Caucasus region and belonging to different fami-
lies (including Indo-European), Tsez has a three-way opposition among its plain stops. In
addition to voiced [b], for instance, there are two voiceless correspondents, slightly aspi-
rated [p] and ejective [p’]. The ejective is formed by closing the vocal cords, closing the
lips, raising the larynx to increase pressure within the oral cavity, and then releasing the

closure at the lips (and releasing the closure of the vocal cords
at the same time or just after). The release of the compressed
air creates the “popping” sound that is characteristic of ejective
consonants. The vocal cord (glottal) closure is what is crucial
to ejective sounds; this contrasts them with all other phonemes
of the language, which use air directly from the lungs. There
is only a two-way opposition among the affricates and uvu-
lars, with no voiced counterparts. Despite the richness of their
consonant system, speakers of Tsez may experience difficulties
with the [dʒ] sound at the beginning of John , which is absent
from their phoneme inventory (and also, incidentally, with the
[f] at the beginning of fish , which Tsez also lacks). The lateral
affricate ƛ consists of a [t] opening out into an [l], much as in
English bottle. The uvulars are pronounced further back in the
mouth than the velars, with the back of the tongue against the
uvula. The pharyngeals involve compressing the larynx to give a hoarse sound. It should
be noted that the uvulars also have pharyngealized counterparts, which are distinct pho-
nemes, and which involve compressing the larynx at the same time as making the uvular
sound. Indeed, in word-initial position some other consonants also have phonemically
distinct pharyngealized counterparts. A rich set of consonant phonemes pronounced in the
back of the mouth (uvulars, pharyngeals) is typical of languages of the North Caucasus, as
well as a number of other Middle Eastern languages, including Arabic. Finally, most (though
not all) consonants can also occur with phonemically distinct labialization, i.e., simultane-
ous lip rounding. To learn more about these sounds, see Stop and Reflect LP7.1.
```
### SIDEBAR LP7.3

```
The IPA symbol [q] typically
represents a voiceless uvular stop. In
Tsez, it is phonetically the voiceless
uvular affricate [qχ], hence its
position in the consonant chart.
Since there is no voiceless uvular
stop in the language, the symbol
q is used to represent this sound
throughout this chapter.

7.3 Clause Structure
In order to explain the basic structure of clauses in Tsez, I
will use some illustrative sentences taken from a folktale, “The
Hen and the Rooster,” collected by Isa Abdullaev. In this story
the rooster cheats on the hen by visiting a frog, after which the
hen gets her revenge by beating up the frog. Eventually, the hen and rooster are recon-
ciled, although the long-term fate of the frog remains, alas, unknown. Since sentences
in Tsez narratives have a tendency to be rather long, incorporating several clauses (a
point to which I return below), some material (in particular, dependent clauses) has
been omitted from the sentences as they appear in the original story. A list of glosses
is provided in Textbox LP7.2.

### TEXTBOX LP7.1 EVIDENCE OF A LINGUISTIC AREA

```
You might notice that the consonant inventory of Tsez
shares a number of features with that of Kabardian,
another language of the Caucasus. For example,
both languages have a series of ejective stops, many
```
```
velar and uvular stops and fricatives, and a voiceless
pharyngeal fricative. These features, together with
others, are found in many languages of the region and
suggest that the Caucasus is a linguistic area.

The core of this clause is mamalay bik’in ‘the rooster went’; indeed, this could be a well-formed
clause and sentence in isolation. The verb - ik ’ i - ‘go’ is an intransitive verb, like its English coun-
terpart, and requires only a single argument, the one that goes. In Tsez, the noun phrase refer-
ring to this argument, mamalay ‘rooster,’ is in its citation form , that is, the form that would
be given if one were to ask a speaker of Tsez: “What is the word for rooster in your language?”
For reasons that will become clear below, I will call this form of a noun the absolutive case,
abbreviated ABS. So a Tsez intransitive verb takes a single argument in the absolutive case.
The word ɬoħ roder ‘to the frog’ is not an obligatory constituent of the clause, but none-
theless it paves the way for a discussion of one of the most fascinating aspects of Tsez
morphology. The absolutive case of this word is ɬ o ħ ro ; so in order to express the idea ‘the
frog went,’ a Tsez speaker would say ɬ o ħ ro bik’in , as one would predict from the preceding
```
7.3.1 Intransitive Verbs

```
Consider the first example (1):

**(1)**


**501 Language Profile 7 Tsez**

```
discussion. But in Example (1), the word for ‘frog’ is in a different case. In fact, the word
ɬ oƫroder includes two case suffixes in succession, - de , which I have glossed as APUD, and
```
- _r_ , which I have glossed as **lative** (abbreviated LAT). _Apud_ is a Latin preposition meaning
‘beside, at the house of, in the presence of,’ and is used as a convenient gloss for a Tsez
    case suffix that expresses location beside an entity, especially
    an animate (including human) entity. The expression ɬ _o_ ħ _ro-de_
    on its own is well-formed in Tsez and simply means ‘beside the
    frog,’ referring to a static location near the frog. Other case suf-
    fixes can express different kinds of location in Tsez, as in ɬ _o_ ħ _ro-_ ƛ’
    ‘frog-SUPER,’ i.e., ‘on the frog,’ or ɬ _oƫro-_ ƛ ‘frog-SUB,’ i.e., ‘under the
frog,’ where I again use Latinate glosses for convenience (Latin SUPER ‘above, on top of’; SUB
‘under’). Note that the suffix for SUPER has an ejective lateral affricate (ƛ’), while that for SUB
has a plain lateral affricate (ƛ).
    The addition of lative _-r_ expresses motion to(ward), so _Ѥo_ ħ _ro-de-r_ ‘frog-APUD-LAT’ means
‘to beside the frog.’ In English we would probably be content with just ‘to the frog,’ but
Tsez requires greater explicitness. We can now form words meaning ‘onto the frog’ and ‘to
under the frog’ by adding the lative, although some vowel insertion is needed in Tsez to
avoid consonant clusters not tolerated by the language: ɬ _o_ ħ _ro-_ ƛ _’o-r_ ‘frog-SUPER-LAT’; ɬ _o_ ħ _ro-_ ƛ _-er_
‘frog-SUB-LAT.’ In addition to the lative suffix indicating motion to(ward), Tsez also has an
ablative suffix - _Ɨy_ , indicating motion (away) from. We can now form ɬ _o_ ħ _ro-d-_ ā _y_ ‘frog-APUD-
ABL,’ i.e., ‘away from beside the frog’ (though again English would probably be content with
just ‘from the frog’); ɬ _o_ ħ _ro-_ ƛ _’-Ɨy_ ‘frog-SUPER-ABL,’ i.e., ‘from on the frog’ (more idiomatically
in English, ‘off the frog’); and ɬ _oƫro-_ ƛ _-_ ā _y_ ‘frog-SUB-ABL,’ i.e., ‘from under the frog’ (which in
this case is also idiomatic English).
    Stringing cases together in this way to express a combination of a specific location type
(beside, on, under) and location versus motion (at, to, from) is very unusual among the
languages of the world, although it happens to be typical of Nakh-Daghestanian languages.
These languages are often said to have huge case inventories, with scores of cases, but this is
rather misleading: instead, the languages have a rather restricted number of cases and a gen-
eral rule for combining these cases, thus giving rise to a large number of case combinations.
Note that English can sometimes combine prepositions in this way (e.g., ‘from under’),
although this is relatively rare in languages with prepositions (or postpositions), and as we
saw above with literal and idiomatic English translations, not all of the logically expected
combinations are possible or idiomatic in English, in contrast to Tsez.
    Let us now turn to the verb in Example (1). The suffix _-n_ (with a variant _-no_ after a con-
sonant) on the verb is a tense suffix, expressing the so-called past unwitnessed, abbrevi-
ated PST.UNW. The “past” part of this is unsurprising, since Tsez, like English, has a set of
past-tense forms that are used not only for real events that happened in the past but also
conventionally in stories that are told as if they had happened in the past. But what about
“unwitnessed”? It turns out that Tsez has two past tenses, past witnessed (PST.WIT) and past
unwitnessed, distinguished according to whether or not the speaker witnessed the event in
question or not. In Example (1), as is typical for a traditional tale, the speaker, in this case the
narrator, did not witness the events in question, so the past unwitnessed is used. If, however,

the same sentence were to occur not in a traditional tale but as a report on a strange incident

On the website there is a glossed and translated Tsez folktale. Highlight the witnessed evidentials (glossed

Can you explain why the rooster’s utterance uses the unwitnessed evidential?
```
```
Finally, what about the prefix b - on the verb with its mysterious gloss ‘III’? In English,
regular verbs agree with their subjects in person and number in the present tense, with a
distinction between the third-person singular form ( he/she/it sings ), and the form used for
all other person-number combinations ( I/we/you/they sing ). In Tsez, verbs do not agree in
person, but they do agree in number, and also in gender. The gloss III.SG in (1) indicates that
the verb is agreeing with a noun of gender III and in the singular. Incidentally, only verbs
beginning with a vowel can show gender–number agreement, while verbs beginning with a
consonant simply show no agreement, so ‘the rooster crowed’ shows up simply as mamalay
q’oq’o ƛ i-n ‘rooster.ABS crow-PST.UNW.’
Tsez has a system of four genders, each of which triggers a distinct consonant prefix on
vowel-initial verbs in the singular; in the plural, there is a distinct prefix for gender ɪ, while
the other three genders merge into a single corresponding prefix. The forms of the prefixes
are shown in Table LP7.3. These are, incidentally, the only prefixes in the language.
A relatively large number of genders is typical for Nakh-Daghestanian languages, with
three to five being common and larger numbers rarer but clearly attested. For languages
with such large numbers of genders, there is a tradition of using the term “noun class”
rather than gender, but there is really no principled basis for this distinction. Just as an
```
```
The grammatical category that indicates the speaker’s source
of the information expressed in a sentence is called evidential-
ity. Tsez has a rather restricted evidential system: evidentiality is
distinguished only with past time reference – the present-tense
verb form bik’ix ‘goes,’ with the present-tense suffix -x , contains
no information as to whether or not the speaker is witnessing
the event – and there is only a binary opposition between wit-
nessed and unwitnessed. Many other languages of the world have a richer set of opposi-
tions, distinguishing, for instance, between information obtained from a visual versus an
auditory source. See Stop and Reflect LP7.2.
```
### SIDEBAR LP7.7

```
Evidentiality is also described in
Section 13.2.2 and in the South
Conchucos Quechua Language
Profile, Section LP6.2.7.
```

**503 Language Profile 7 Tsez**

```
adjective in Spanish has to agree in gender (and number) with its noun (masculine -o in
hombre delgado ‘thin man,’ but feminine - a in mujer delgada ‘thin woman’), in Tsez a vow-
el-initial verb must agree in gender and number.
There is little in the form of a Tsez noun to tell what gender it belongs to (unlike Spanish,
for instance, where nearly all nouns ending in - o are masculine), although there are some
semantic correlates to the various genders. This is clearest with gender I, which includes
all and only nouns denoting male humans (and assimilated supernatural beings). Gender
II includes all nouns denoting female humans, but also a fair number of inanimate nouns.
Gender III includes all nouns denoting animals, but also a large number of nouns denot-
ing inanimates. Gender IV contains only inanimates, including abstract nouns. Thus, for
nouns denoting humans and animals, gender is predictable, but inanimate nouns can
belong to any of genders II, III, and IV. The precise factors determining gender assignment
remain to be worked out, and there may be a large element of purely conventional assign-
ment, but semantic analogy and formal analogy (e.g., initial or final consonants that are
similar to the singular gender prefix) both seem to play a role. Given this information
about Tsez gender–number prefixes on verbs, mamalay b-ik’i-n ‘the rooster went’ could
be changed to: uži ik’i-n ‘the boy went,’ kid y-ik’in ‘the girl went,’ uži-bi b-ik’i-n ‘the boys
went,’ or mamalay-bi r-ik’i-n ‘the roosters went,’ where - bi is the absolutive plural suffix. It
should be noted that the absence of a prefix on a vowel-initial
verb specifically indicates gender I singular and is in no sense a
neutral form.
Before leaving gender, we may note one difference between
English and Tsez with regard to the conventions for gender of
personified animals. In English, the tendency is to treat person-
ified animals as humans, and to refer to them as he and she. In
Tsez, personified animals remain animals, and therefore take gender III agreement. This is
absolutely consistent through all such tales I have encountered, even in an example like
“The Hen and the Rooster” where the participants have such gender-stereotyped roles (e.g.,
errant husband, betrayed wife, “the other woman”).
```
```
7.3.2 Transitive Verbs
Let us now consider a transitive verb, that is, one having an agent or agent-like argument
and a patient or patient-like argument, as in (3). The English translation of (3) contains a
verb break that can be both transitive (as here) and intransitive ( The leg broke ), but Tsez has
no verbs of this kind, and the verb - ecur - is unequivocally transitive, requiring two argu-
ments. (The Tsez equivalent to English intransitive ‘break’ is the related verb - ecu -.)

hen-ERG II.SG-break-PST.UNW leg.ABS
‘The hen broke [the frog’s] leg.’
```
```
Let us first consider the case-marking in (3). In English, most noun phrases appearing as
core arguments of intransitive or transitive verbs show no case-marking, but some personal
pronouns do. As can be seen in Examples (4) and (5), in English the single argument of an
intransitive verb (abbreviated as S), and the agent-like argument of a transitive verb (abbre-
viated A) are in the so-called nominative (NOM) case, while the patient-like argument of a
transitive verb (abbreviated P) is in the so-called accusative (ACC) case.
```
**(4)** _He went_.
S
NOM

```
(5) He hit me.
AP
NOM ACC
Tsez has a different system, which holds for nearly all noun phrases in the language.
Compare examples (6) and (7) below to (4) and (5) above. In a transitive clause, it is the
P that appears in the same case as the S of an intransitive clause, while the A appears in a
different case. Conventionally, the case used for S and P is called the absolutive (ABS), while
the case used for A is called the ergative (ERG).

(7) ono č - ā y-ecur-no k’on č u
hen-ERG II.SG-break-PST.UNW leg.ABS
AP
ERG ABS
‘The hen broke the leg.’
In (7), the citation form of the word ‘leg’ is k’on č u , and as with all Tsez nouns this is the
form used as absolutive. The citation form and absolutive for ‘hen’ is ono č u. The ergative
suffix in Tsez is - Ɨ. As A of its clause in (7), the word for ‘hen’ must appear in the ergative,
i.e., as ono č - Ɨ. (The final vowel of the stem is dropped before the ergative suffix to avoid
vowel hiatus.) The case-marking system of Tsez is thus an ergative-absolutive system, in
contrast to the nominative-accusative system found (albeit only with some personal pro-
nouns) in English. Ergative-absolutive case-marking is widespread among the indige-
nous languages of the Caucasus.
```

**505 Language Profile 7 Tsez**

```
But what about verb agreement in (7)? The word for ‘hen,’
like all animal nouns, belongs to gender III. The word for ‘leg’
belongs to gender II. Clearly, in (7) the verb agrees with ‘leg,’
i.e., with the P of its clause, not the A. More generally, Tsez
verbs agree with their absolutive argument, i.e., like case-mark-
ing, verb agreement operates on an ergative-absolutive basis. In
English, by contrast, verb agreement, just like case-marking of
pronouns, operates on a nominative-accusative basis, so that in
The dogs chase the cat or The cat chases the dog , the verb agrees with the A, just as it agrees
with the S of an intransitive verb.

### CHAPTER SUMMARY

```
The scope of this profile has enabled us to examine only a few of the linguistic features
of Tsez, concentrating on those that can be introduced in a concise manner without
presupposing other information about the language’s structure. These have included
the remarkable consonant inventory, numerous case-markers that indicate location and
direction, an evidential distinction, four gender classes, and ergative-absolutive case-
marking. Many relevant features, such as word order, have gone untreated. (For the
record, depending on the specific discourse contexts, any rearrangements of the words in
the Tsez sentences cited would be possible.) But I hope to have shown how one can gain
at least some insight into cross-linguistic diversity by examining a language with a very
different typological profile from those which are familiar to us.

    many near-minimal pairs? Provide a list of each.
**2. Verb morphology**
    In this language profile, we noted that Tsez verbs can change their form by adding both prefixes and
    suffixes. The only prefixes are those indicating agreement in gender. Suffixes include those indicating tense,
    in particular the past witnessed and past unwitnessed tenses that were introduced in the profile.
    Below, you are given examples of intransitive clauses with various verbs and subjects, in both of the past
    tenses. You will notice that there is some variation across different verbs. For instance, some verbs in the
    past witnessed end in _-si_ , while others end in _-s_ ; likewise, the past unwitnessed shows variation between
    _-no_ and _-n_. Also, some verbs agree with the subject, as noted in the language profile, while other verbs do
    not.

**3. Noun morphology**

```
In this language profile, an introduction was given to the interesting system of Tsez cases expressing
location (see Textbox LP7.2). In addition to the location types discussed in the profile, two more are
introduced here, namely location near and location at. The latter is also used in the expression of
possession. For this reason it is glossed POSS ‘possessive.’ When used by itself, the simple possessive form
of a noun indicates that the noun is in someone’s possession (thus the meaning is similar to that of the
verb ‘have’). When the possessive is combined with the lative suffix, it indicates movement into someone’s
possession (as with the verb ‘give’). When the possessive is combined with the ablative, it indicates
movement out of someone’s possession (as with the verb ‘take away’).
The examples in Table LP7.4 give the various case combinations possible for two nouns, besuro ‘fish’ and
halma ɣ ‘friend.’
```
```

```
```
+LAT halma ɣƛ ’or halma ɣ xor halma ɣ der halma ɣ qor
```
```
The system is very logical: one combines a suffix for a type of location from the horizontal axis with a suffix
for location or motion on the vertical axis.
i. Divide the suffixes from the stems. Do you observe variation in the stems or in the suffixes?
ii. Begin the morphological analysis by focusing on the forms with the single suffix only (i.e., the first and
fourth row). List the forms of the SUPER, AD, APUD, and POSS suffixes. You will notice that three of these
suffixes each have two allomorphs. The allomorphs with the final vowel are found only on stems that
end with consonants, such as halma ɣ. Suggest a motivation for the additional vowel on just consonant-
final stems, i.e., why should this be? ( Hint : Try pronouncing the forms with and without the vowel.)
iii. Next address the ablative suffix. What is its form? Why do we not find the -o allomorphs of the SUPER,
AD, APUD, and POSS suffixes co-occurring with the ablative case-marker? For example, why do we find
halma ɣ qƗy , rather than *halma ɣ qo ā y? Also, consider the APUD-ABL forms besurodƗ y and halma ɣ dƗ y.
State in prose the phonetic process that has occurred, and then write a rule.
iv. Now consider the lative forms. What is the form of the lative suffix? Here we find the - o allomorphs of
the suffixes reappearing (as you saw in b). Why should this be?
v. Another set of forms, those with the sub (‘under’) suffix, follows:
SUB
besuro ƛ halma ɣ e ƛ
+ ABL besuro ƛā y halma ɣƛā y
+ LAT besuro ƛ er halma ɣƛ er
You will notice the vowel /e/ occurring in halmaћeω , but in none of the other forms. Is it best to analyze
this /e/ as part of the stem, part of the suffix, or as a vowel inserted by rule? Explain the reasoning for your
answer. What about the /e/ in the lative forms? Write a single rule that applies in both cases and discuss its
phonetic motivation.
```

vi. Two further Tsez nouns are ziru ‘fox’ and the man’s name idris ‘Idris.’ Using everything you have
learned about the phonology so far, determine the correct Tsez forms for each of the following. (The
English versions are sometimes unidiomatic.)
a. ‘from under the fox’ SUB-ABL
b. ‘from near Idris’ AD-ABL
c. ‘on the fox’ SUPER
d. ‘by Idris’ APUD
e. ‘to by the fox’ APUD-LAT
f. ‘to under Idris’ SUB-LAT
g. ‘from by the fox’ APUD-ABL
h. ‘under Idris’ SUB
i. ‘to on the fox’ SUPER-LAT
j. ‘near Idris’ AD
```
**4. Pronoun morphology and agreement**
    Nearly all nouns and most pronouns in Tsez distinguish an absolutive case and an ergative case, as in the
    examples in the profile. However, first- and second-person singular pronouns are exceptions, since they
    have an invariable form, _di_ (first-person singular) and _mi_ (second-person singular), used for all of S, A, and
    P. Below, you are given some examples of intransitive and transitive clauses with first- and second-person
    singular pronoun arguments.
       **a.** _di ik’is._ ‘I went (man speaking).’
       **b.** _di yik’is._ ‘I went (woman speaking).’
       **c.** _di bik’is_ ‘I went (frog speaking, e.g., in a story).’
       **d.** _mi ik’is._ ‘You went (speaking to man).’
       **e.** _mi yik’is._ ‘You went (speaking to woman).’
       **f.** _mi bik’is_ ‘You went (speaking to animal).’
       **g.** _di mi egirsi_ ‘I sent you (woman speaking to man).’
       **h.** _di mi egirsi_ ‘I sent you (man speaking to man).’
       **i.** _di mi yegirsi_ ‘I sent you (woman speaking to woman).’
       **j.** _di mi yegirsi_ ‘I sent you (man speaking to woman).’
       **k.** _di mi begirsi_ ‘I sent you (woman speaking to animal).’
       **l.** _di mi begirsi_ ‘I sent you (man speaking to animal).’
The focus of this problem is on verb agreement. State which argument(s) the verb agrees with in (i)
intransitive and (ii) transitive clauses. Is the agreement pattern the same as, or different from, that for full
noun phrases?


**LANGUAGE PROFILE 8**

Bardi

8.1 **Introduction**

```
Bardi is one of Australia’s 320 or so Indigenous languages. The name of the language is
pronounced [‘bɐޝɖi] (see Sidebar LP8.2). Bardi is one of several dialects of a language that
is also (confusingly!) called Bardi. Other dialects include Jawi [ɟaޝwɪ] (which begins with a
voiced palatal stop) and Bard (or Baard) [bɐޝɖ]. Bardi is also an
ethnonym (the name of the people of the area).
Most Bardi people live in the northwest of Western Australia,
in an area called the Kimberley region. The main Bardi com-
munities are One Arm Point and Lombadina. Bardi people also
live in towns such as Broome and Derby, and in outstations
(outposts from the communities). Bardi people are sea people;
Bardi and Jawi traditional territories included not only the tip
of the Dampier peninsula but also the neighboring islands. The
Bardi are one of many groups that inhabited Australia prior to contact with Europeans. See
Textbox LP8.1 for a related note.
The number of Bardi speakers is quite small. It is not certain
exactly how many speakers there are. As of 2018, only about five
people speak the language fluently, but many more can under-
stand it and some can speak it a bit. There are about one thou-
sand Bardi people in total.
Although only the oldest people in Bardi communities speak
Bardi fluently, some young Bardi children are interested in their
language and culture, and there is a language program at One
Arm Point school. While the Bardi language is in a fragile state,
Bardi people are taking action to make sure their language con-
tinues and that their culture is strong.
Bardi is a member of the Nyulnyulan language family. This
family has about eight languages in it. They are all spoken in the Western Kimberley region
of Western Australia. Nyulnyulan is one of twenty-eight language families that are indige-
nous to the Australian mainland and the Torres Strait.

community who are working to

### SIDEBAR LP8.2

```
Transcription note
The symbol [ɖ] represents a
voiced retroflex stop. In Bardi,
this is pronounced with the tip of
the tongue making contact just
behind the alveolar ridge. In some
languages retroflection is made with
the underside of the tongue, but in
Bardi the contact is with the tongue
tip.

8.2 Basic Typological Overview
8.2.1 Phonetics and Phonology
The Bardi phonemic inventory has seventeen consonants and seven vowels. As in roughly
half of Australian languages, Bardi has five places of articulation for stops and nasals. These
include a set of retroflex consonants, as well bilabial, dental, palatal, and velar ones.
Bardi also has a distinction between two types of r-sounds, a feature which is common in
Australian languages. For example, ara (with an approximant, somewhat like English [ɹ])
means ‘other,’ but arra (with a trill [r]), means ‘no’ or ‘don’t.’ There are also three different
laterals: retroflex /ɭ/, palatal /ʎ/, and alveolar /l/. There is no phonemic voicing contrast in
consonants. Bardi distinguishes between long and short vowels.

### TEXTBOX LP8.1 WHAT SHOULD WE CALL THE FIRST PEOPLES OF AUSTRALIA?

```
There are several terms used to describe Australia’s First
Peoples. The term “native” is offensive in Australia,
and “First Nation” is not used. The most widely used
terms are “Aboriginal” and “Torres Strait Islander”
```
```
or “Indigenous.” However, some people don’t like
the term “Indigenous,” because they feel it has been
imposed on them by Europeans, and that it serves to
remove Aboriginal people from public discourse.
```

8.2.2 Argument Marking on the Verb

```
Bardi has extensive morphological marking of grammatical relations, found in both verb
agreement and case-marking. Within the verb, the subject, object (if there is one), oblique
argument (e.g., benefactive), and possessor are all indexed mor-
phologically. The subject argument is indicated by a prefix, while
other NPs (as well as some types of adjuncts) are indicated by
clitics , which follow the verb root and tense marking. Example
(1) has a third-person prefix i - which indexes the subject argu-
ment Jibaji.
```
**(1)**

### SIDEBAR LP8.3

```
For more on clitics, see the Manange
Language Profile, Textbox LP3.5.
```
### SIDEBAR LP8.4

```
For this discussion of argument
marking on the verb, it might
be helpful to review Section 6.3,
on arguments, transitivity, and
grammatical relations.
```
### SIDEBAR LP8.5

```
For more on aspect, see the Manange
Language Profile, Textbox LP3.8.
```
```
Jibaji aarl-on i -na-ng-gala-na-na
Jibaji fish-LOC 3-TR-PST-wander-CONT.REM.PST
‘Jibaji was fishing.’
```
```
This example also shows that tense can be marked in two places in the Bardi verb. Here it
is marked both by the prefix ng -, which indicates past tense, and again by the suffix -na ,
which indicates that the action of the verb occurred a while
ago, hence in the remote past rather than the recent or imme-
diate past. The other suffix - na marks the action as continuous.
This is a type of aspect , a grammatical category independent
of tense that indicates, for example, whether an event is con-
tinuous, completed, or habitual. Since Example (1) has both
the past and the continuous, the verb translates into English as
‘was fishing.’ Also of note here is the prefix na -, which explic-
itly marks the verb root as being transitive (we’ll come back to
this below).
Example (2) illustrates a clitic on the verb that indicates that
the indirect object is first-person plural (i.e., ‘us’).
```

come.toward 3 - TR-catch-REM.PST= 1 PL.IO rain cyclone this.way
‘A cyclone came toward us.’ (Bessie Ejai: janjal.wav)
```
```
This example contains two other interesting features of Bardi. First, it contains a complex
predicate , two or more words that act as a single predicate of a single clause, with one
set of arguments. Each word in a complex predicate contributes to the overall meaning.
In (2) the sequence way innyanajard is a complex predicate constructed of the preverb way
and the verb innya-najard ; these structures will be discussed in more detail below. Secondly,
this clause illustrates a type of classification that is quite common in Australia. A general
noun (in this case, oola ‘(fresh) water, rain’) is juxtaposed with a more specific item ( janjali
‘cyclone’).
The verb in Example (3) carries both a prefix nga -, indicating a first-person singular sub-
ject, and the clitic =rri , which marks the second-person singular object.
```

1 SG-ERG ignore 1 SG-TR-FUT-do-FUT= 2 SG.P
‘I won’t listen to you.’
```
```
This is also a good example of double future-tense marking; the verb ngankiyarri has both a
future-tense prefix k- and a future-tense suffix -( y ) a. Just as in Example (1), this verb has a
prefix (here n -) that marks it as being transitive.
Finally, Example (4) shows oblique agreement in addition to the marking of subject and
direct object. The verb has the third-person-singular subject marker i -, the object marker
= irr (which is coreferential with aarli ‘fish’), and the oblique clitic = jin , which could indicate
either a possessor argument (i.e., his fish), or a beneficiary (i.e., cooked a fish for him).

### STOP AND REFLECT LP.8.1 COMPARE CASE SYSTEMS ACROSS LANGUAGES

```
In addition to Bardi, three other languages described in the Language Profiles have extensive systems of cases
that mark location and direction: Finnish (LP4.3), Tsez (LP7.3), and Manambu (LP10.3.2) Choose one of these
systems and compare it to Bardi. What cases do they have in common? How do they differ? Examine the
system of a third language. Are there cases that are unique to each?
```
```
In (5), Bessie Ejai is describing how an animal was made in the shape of a house. She uses
the semblative case to describe how something is similar to something else.
```
```
Ginyinggon i-na-marra-na-n=jin=irr aarli.
then 3 - TR-cook-CONT-REM.PST= 3 SG.OBL= 3 PL.P fish
‘Then he cooked his fish/then he cooked the fish for him.’
```
```
The examples in (1)–(4) give you a lot of information about how Bardi works. We can see
that the marking of grammatical relations on the verb is a salient element of Bardi mor-
phology. We have also seen that Bardi grammar has extensive marking of tense and aspect,
as well as complex predicates.
```
```
8.2.3 Case-Marking
Another important feature of Bardi is case-marking. It has quite a few different cases,
including ergative (illustrated in (3) above) and absolutive on core arguments (these will be
discussed more fully below), but also locative (roughly ‘at’), allative (‘to’), ablative (‘from’),
semblative (‘like’), comitative (‘with’), and a few others. Many of these cases provide infor-
mation about the location of an item, whether someone is going with someone else or
using something as an instrument, or whether something looks like something else. Some
of these grammatical cases are illustrated in the following examples. See Stop and Reflect 8.1

Example (7) has a locative case; here indicating that one thing is on another. This case
can also be used for other spatial relationships (e.g., ‘at,’ ‘in’; see Textbox LP8.2), combined
with a spatial adverb (e.g., ‘under,’ ‘above’), or used for certain types of motion.
```
**(7)**

### TEXTBOX LP8.2 DESCRIBING SPACE

```
Bardi case-marking can be combined with spatial
adverbs to allow speakers to make more precise
descriptions of space. For example, in (7) one could
```
```
also say garndi nalmonon ‘on top of the woman’s head,’
using garndi ‘on top’ in addition to the case-marking
on nalmonon.

```
Examples (8) and (9) illustrate one of the cases that is used on
core arguments: the ergative. (For further discussion of ergative
alignment , see Textbox LP8.3.) In Bardi, ergative case-marking
is consistently found on subject arguments of transitive clauses.
In (8), an example appears on the second-person pronoun, the
subject of the transitive verb aniwijirri ‘you poke it,’ while in
(9) it is found on the noun phrase aamba ‘man,’ the subject of
injalajarrmoordoo ‘he is looking at us.’

### (9)

```
8.2.4 Constituent Order
In English and many other languages, as you’ve seen, the order of constituents is fixed in
such a way as to indicate grammatical relations. Since English is an SVO language, with the
subject argument consistently preceding the verb, which precedes the object, sentences like
The dog bit Dorothy and Dorothy bit the dog have critically different meanings. Bardi constitu-
ent order is not fixed in this way; the order of constituents in a sentence is much more free
than it is in more familiar languages (in fact, Bardi can also omit arguments much more
than English can, so it is quite common to find Bardi sentences which only have verbs in
them, and no nouns, pronouns, or adjectives). This does not mean that there is no infor-
mation provided by the order of words in Bardi. The order of constituents in Bardi is used
to structure information for the hearer. For example, the first item in the clause is the gram-
matical focus; it is the most important piece of information in the clause. Here “important”
means something like ‘what the speaker most wants the hearer to focus on’ For example,
answers to content questions appear in the first position in the clause. Similarly, the choice
between using a full noun phrase or omitting it provides a way for the speaker and hearer to
keep track of the participants in the discourse. (See Stop and Reflect 8.3.) Constituent order
will be the focus of more extensive discussion below.

You might notice something unusual in (10) concerning the placement of the case-marker.
Many languages have case-marking that goes on every item in a noun phrase; examples are
Russian and Latin. Other languages have case-marking which goes only on the final item
in the phrase; Japanese and Turkish are languages like this. Bardi is different: in Bardi, the
case-marker goes on only the first item in the phrase.

```

**516 Claire Bowern**

8.2.5 Word Classes

```
Bardi has nouns and verbs, just like all other languages. There are both distributional
and morphological reasons for distinguishing between nouns and verbs in this language.
Nouns in Bardi can appear as the subjects of transitive sentences (where they take ergative
case-marking and verbal agreement). That is, nouns can be arguments of verbs, but verbs
can’t be arguments of verbs. Nouns can be replaced by pronouns, such as ginyinggi ‘he, she,
it’ or irr ‘they’; however, no other word class can replace a verb. Bardi nouns take case-mark-
ing, while verbs take a lot of other, different morphology. Verbs are marked for tense and
aspect, for the person and number of their subject (and object, if present), and for transi-
tivity. Examples of nouns in Bardi include oorany ‘woman,’ aarli ‘fish,’ liyan ‘heart, spirit,’
mayi ‘food,’ and many others. Nouns form an open word class. Examples of verbs in Bardi
include - joogooloo - ‘break,’ - ni - ‘be, sit,’ and - booloo - ‘come.’ Verbs in Bardi are not an open
word class. There are about 250 of them in the language, but they are a closed set. Bardi
```
### TEXTBOX LP8.3 ERGATIVE-ABSOLUTIVE VERSUS NOMINATIVE-ACCUSATIVE

### ALIGNMENT

```
Grammatical phenomena such as agreement and
case-marking can group arguments in different
ways. Sometimes the single core argument of an
intransitive verb (abbreviated as S) is treated in the
same way as the more agentive core argument of a
transitive or ditransitive verb (abbreviated as A), thus
defining the subject grammatical relation. Bardi verb
agreement is of this type. In the examples below, the
verb takes the third-person prefix i - in agreement
with the S argument in (a) and with the A argument
in (b). An entirely different marker is used for the
non-agentive core argument (abbreviated as P) in
example (b).
a.
```
```
b. Aamba-nim i -n-jala = jarrmoordoo.
man-ERG 3 - TR-look.at=1PL.P
A P
‘A man’s looking at us!’
However, case-marking in Bardi groups arguments in
a different way. The A argument is singled out with a
special marker (- nim , called the ergative ), while both S
and P arguments receive no marking. An unmarked S
can be seen in example (a); an unmarked P can be seen
in (c):

When grammatical phenomena group S and P in this
way, the category is called absolutive , which is a type of
grammatical relation.
These different grammatical relations are called
alignment patterns because the single intransitive
argument sometimes aligns grammatically with the
more-agentive transitive argument, and sometimes with
the less-agentive transitive argument. These patterns are
illustrated in the figure below.

does not borrow inflecting verbs, and there are no word-formation processes that create
new inflecting verbs out of other material.
Although Bardi verbs are a closed class, there is another word class, preverbs, which com-
bine with verbs to provide verbal meanings (see Textbox LP8.4). Preverbs are an open word
class in Bardi. They never appear on their own in a sentence; preverbs can be identified by
the fact that they occur immediately before the (inflecting) verb, and they are the only type
of word that can appear between the negative marker arra and the inflecting verb.
```
```
(11)
```
```
Bardi also has a class of adjectives. However, it is not a very
clearly defined class, as Bardi adjectives share many properties
with Bardi nouns, much more so than in languages like English.
For example, like nouns, Bardi adjectives can be heads of noun
phrases. Adjectives also have some behaviors that are not shared
with nouns. Adjectives can be used as preverbs, where they have
a systematic relationship with their inflecting verb. This is a very
productive pattern for adjectives but does not occur with nouns. For example, consider the
adjective boordiji ‘big’ in the following sentences:

### TEXTBOX LP8.4 BORROWED VERBS AND BARDI PREVERBS

```
Preverbs are the mechanism by which Bardi borrows
verbs. A verb borrowed from English, Kriol, or another
language becomes a preverb and occurs with an
additional inflecting verb that carries the agreement,
tense, aspect, and mood information. Here are some
examples (the inflecting verb is given in its root form):
```
```
wajim -ma- ‘wash’
loojim -joo- ‘die’ (from lose’im )
gadim -ma- ‘cut’
All of these verbs have - im on the end of the loaned
preverb. This is the Kriol transitivity marker; it attaches
to all transitive verbs.
```
```
Arra booroo oo-la-la-n-in mara~mara.
NEG look 3.IRR-IRR-see-CONT-REM.PST far
‘He didn’t look around very far.’

```
These adjectives are functioning as preverbs. Evidence for this is that the adjective can
occur between the negative marker arra and the verb:
```
**(13)**

```
Irrjar-nan i-n-jaybi-gal=jarrngay “jan i-n-joo-gal jan baawa?”
three-times 3-TR-ask-REC.PST= 1 SG.P where 3 - TR-do-REC.PST 1 SG.POSS child
‘Three times he asked, “where’s my child?”’
```
```
Arra boordiji oo-l-i-n.
NEG big 3 - IRR-do/say-CONT
‘it is not big’
```
```
Nouns cannot occur in these constructions; the sentence *arra iila oolin – with iila ‘dog’
in the position of a preverb – is ungrammatical and cannot express the meaning ‘it’s not
a dog.’ Remember from the previous example that the order of elements in a negative
verb phrase is arra + preverb + verb; the ungrammaticality of sentences like * arra iila
oolin is good evidence that nouns can’t productively derive preverbs, but adjectives can.
Thus, nouns and adjectives can be distinguished by their behavior in Bardi. Another
property that distinguishes adjectives from nouns is that adjectives, but not nouns, can
be modified by giija ‘very’; so that you can say boordiji giija ‘very big,’ but not * iila giija
‘very dog.’
Bardi has only four numbers: ‘one,’ ‘two,’ ‘three,’ and ‘four’ ( arinyji, gooyarra, irrjar, and
gooyarragooyarra ). For the most part, numbers behave like adjectives in their syntax, with
a few exceptions: numbers take derivational morphology that other adjectives can’t. For
example, ‘three’ is irrjar and you can use a ‘times’ suffix, - nan , to say irrjar-nan ‘three times,’
but not * loogal-nan ‘bad times.’
```
**(14)**

```
Bardi has two conjunctions: agal ‘and’ and gorror ‘or.’ It doesn’t have adpositions or articles.
The functions of English prepositions, like to, at , and beside , are split between Bardi case-mark-
ers and adverbs. Bardi does not have a morpheme like the English article the , which indicates
when a noun phrase is definite (identifiable). Instead, Bardi speak-
ers use demonstratives like jarri ‘this’ and the presence or absence of
a full noun to give information about the definiteness of the noun
phrase. For example, if a noun is omitted in discourse, then it is usu-
ally identifiable, and known to the speaker and hearer. The first time
something is mentioned, it is represented with a noun phrase, but
in subsequent mentions, noun phrases are typically omitted and the
argument is represented only by agreement marking.
Bardi has a class of personal pronouns with three singular and five non-singular members
(see Textbox LP8.5 for discussion of the non-singular categories). The full set of personal
pronouns is given in Table LP8.1.
Bardi pronouns have different behaviors from those in languages such as English.
For example, the third-person pronouns can be used to modify nouns; in this use, they

core arguments may sometimes

```
### TEXTBOX LP8.5 CATEGORIES OF NON-SINGULAR PRONOUNS

```
Table LP8.1 illustrates the fact that Bardi has more
plural pronouns than singular pronouns. These extra
forms are found in the first-person category, that is,
references that include the speaker. There is a special
first-person dual form, which refers to the speaker and
hearer both (you (sg.) and I). The first-person-plural
forms distinguish between references that include the
hearer (‘we all including you’), and references that
exclude the hearer (‘we but not you’). Such inclusive
```
```
and exclusive distinctions are found in the pronoun
systems in many languages.
Bardi has a number system that is described in
the literature as an “Ilocano” or “minimal/augment”
system. In languages with such systems, there is only
one dual pronoun (the first-person dual inclusive ayoo
in Bardi). There are no other dual pronouns; the first-
person dual exclusive is signaled by arroodoo , which
also marks plural exclusive.
```
```
function a bit like demonstratives, as in ginyinggi aamba ‘that man’ or ginyinggi-nim baawa
‘that child’ (in ergative form). They are not frequently used, since the functions of pro-
nouns like English he and you are mostly taken up by Bardi verbal agreement marking, as
seen in examples like (11) and (14).
```
```
8.2.6 Constituency
One of the key diagnostics for word classes in many languages is the use and positioning
of words in different types of phrases. For example, in English only prepositions can func-
tion as heads of prepositional phrases, and auxiliary verbs must precede verbs in a verb
phrase. We also saw in Chapter 4 that constituency and morphological structure together
provide the main evidence for different types of word classes. In the previous section, most
of the evidence presented for Bardi word classes was morphological (e.g., verbs take agree-
ment morphology while nouns take case-marking), although there was also some evidence
regarding syntactic structure (e.g., preverbs occur between the negative particle and the
verb, while nouns do not). Constituent order plays a somewhat limited role for identifying
word classes in Bardi. This is because constituent order in this language is quite a bit more
flexible than in some other more familiar languages, and this makes the use of constituent
structure as a diagnostic for word classes a bit more subtle.
```

**520 Claire Bowern**

```
As an example, consider the following English sentence:
```
**(15)** _I ate two fish yesterday_.

```
One piece of evidence that two and fish are in the same phrasal constituent (here the object
noun phrase) is that they cannot be separated by other elements of the sentence:
```
**(16)** * _I two ate fish yesterday.
*Two I ate fish yesterday_.

```
Here are two Bardi sentences, both equivalent in meaning to (15):
```
**(17) a.**
Sound
file for
(17)

```
Nga-n-arli-gal gooyarra aarli bardi.
1 SG-TR-eat-REC.PST two fish yesterday
```
```
b. Gooyarra nga-n-arli-gal aarli bardi.
two 1 SG-TR-eat-REC.PST fish Yesterday
```
```
Both orderings are perfectly acceptable and used by speakers. In Bardi, it is grammatical to
split numerals from their associated nouns; the two sentences (one with the numeral sepa-
rate, the other with it adjacent) highlight different aspects of the situation. Example (17a)
is the usual – or unmarked – way of expressing this situation, while (17b) implies that the
number was different than expected, i.e., ‘It was two!’ (e.g., as opposed to three).
Does this mean that Bardi “has no grammar” or “has no evidence for phrasal constit-
uency?” No, although it does mean we need to look beyond the obvious diagnostics for
phrasal constituency and find Bardi-specific evidence that words combine into phrases.
The first piece of evidence for a noun-phrase constituent is that case-markers are suffixed
to the first word of the noun phrase (as noted above; see, e.g., Example (10)). This tells us
that nothing to the left of that word belongs in the phrase.
Second, nouns (and noun phrases, by implication) in Bardi have dependents, just as
English noun phrases do. There are possessors, adjectives, and relative clauses. They obey
the same restriction that the case-marker goes on the first word of the phrase.
```
```
[Ngay-nim jan gooloo jina-rr irrmoorra]
1 SG-ERG 1 SG.POSS father 3 SG.POSS-3PL.POSSEE paternal.aunt
```
```
baanigarr gorna balab i-ngi-rr-i-na-na.
when good there 3 - PST-PL-do-CONT-REM.PST
‘My father’s aunties were really happy about it then [that my father got back safely].’
```
```
In this sentence, the subject is the complex noun phrase ngaynim jan gooloo jinarr irrmoorra
‘my father’s aunties.’ The ergative marker - nim goes on the first word of the phrase, the
first-person singular pronoun ngay. (A standard way of marking possession in Bardi is to
denote the possessor by a noun or pronoun followed by a possessive pronoun. So the com-
plex noun phrase in (18) would be more literally translated as ‘I my father his aunties.’ The
third-person possessive pronoun jinarr cross-references the person and number of both the
possessor and the possessed.)

A third type of evidence for a noun-phrase constituent is that
we can replace a noun phrase with a pronoun. So in the previous
example, we can replace ngaynim jan gooloo jinarr irrmoorra ‘my
father’s aunties’ with irrnim 3 PL-ERG ‘they (ergative).’
Noun-phrase elements don’t have an absolutely fixed order,
but they do have a set of strong tendencies. For example, noun
heads tend to be final in their phrases. So, adjectives, posses-
sors, locational phrases, and quality phrases (e.g., the man with a
beard ) all usually precede the noun.
```
```
8.2.7 Constituent Order in Discourse
Throughout this book, languages have been commonly described as having a dominant
constituent order, such as SVO, SOV, VSO. Bardi word order is not easily described in this
way. Consider Table LP8.2, which shows the numbers and percentages of different constit-
uent orders occurring in two Bardi narratives.
There are many things to note from Table LP8.2. The first is that almost half the clauses in
the Bardi narratives contain no free noun-phrase arguments at all (as indicated by the V-only
examples in the last row before the totals), and only three clauses contained both a noun-
phrase subject and a noun-phrase object (two VSO and one OVS). Second, there is a preference
for the nominal argument to follow the verb, independently of whether it is an S-argument
or an O-argument. Third, almost 10 percent of the clauses contain more than one verb with a
common argument (VOV, VSV), or contain a discontinuous argument (OVO, SVS).
From the range of orders found in Bardi, one can conclude that Bardi constituent order
does not signal the grammatical relations of the arguments. The following sentences
describe the same event, but note that the constituent order varies.
```
```
(19)
```
### SIDEBAR LP8.9

```
GLOSSING NOTE
In designating a relationship of
possession, POSS refers to the
possessor, while POSSEE refers to the
entity that is possessed.
```
```
[ Mooloo ] boor i-n-jal=jin [ ara-nim oorany ]
louse.PL look 3 - TR-look=3SG.OBLother-ERG woman
[ ara oorany ] nalm-onon.
other woman 3 SG-head-LOC
‘One woman was looking for lice on another woman’s head.’
```
**(20)** (^) [ _Mooloo_ ] _boor i-n-jal=jin_ [ _ara oorany_ ]
louse.PL look 3 - TR-look=3SG.OBL other woman
[ _ara-nim oorany_ ] _nalm-onon._
other-ERG woman 3 SG-head-LOC
‘One woman was looking for lice on another woman’s head.’
So, if word order doesn’t tell us anything about grammatical relations between argu-
ments and verbs, how do we get that information? It is communicated by a combination
of three things: case-marking, verb agreement, and real-world knowledge. You’ve already
seen a few examples of verb agreement in action, where subjects have person and number
morphemes, and objects have person/number clitics. You’ve also seen some examples of
ergative case-marking, e.g., (8), (9), and elsewhere.

### CHAPTER SUMMARY

```
This language profile has explored a number of typological features of Bardi, such as the
presence of retroflex consonants, an extensive system of local cases, a class of adjectives
that is similar to nouns, and a distinct lexical class of preverbs. Bardi also exhibits an
interesting pattern whereby we find subject marking on the verb, but ergative-absolutive
alignment of case-markers on noun phrases. We’ve also seen that there is evidence for
word classes and constituency in Bardi, although the tests are a little more complex than
in languages with rigid constituent order. Constituent order does not provide information
about the grammatical roles of arguments in the clause. It does, however, provide us with
discourse information about the relative prominence and importance of participants in
the sentence.

### EXERCISES

**1.** Consider again the discussion of Bardi preverbs. In what ways are they similar to auxiliary verbs and in
    what ways are they different? Do you agree with the author that preverbs are not auxiliaries? You may
    want to review the discussion of auxiliary verbs in Chapter 5, Section 5.3, in formulating your answer.
**2.** Examine the following Bardi words (in IPA), along with their English translations:
    ŋ _ijambal_ ə ‘my foot’ ŋ _imi_ ŋ _gar_ ‘my shadow’
    _nijambal_ ə ‘his foot’ _nimi_ ŋ _gar_ ‘his shadow’
    _ir_ ɟ _ambal_ ə ‘their feet’ _irmi_ ŋ _gar_ ‘their shadow’
    _gur_ ɟ _ambal_ ə ‘your feet’ _gurmi_ ŋ _gar_ ‘your shadow’
    **a.** What are the root morphemes in these words?
    **b.** Which morpheme means ‘my’?
    **c.** Do any of the morphemes alternate? If so, which one(s), and what is the environment for alternation?
    **d.** If ɟə _la_ ŋ _gun_ means ‘elbow,’ how would you say ‘his elbow’?

**3.** Put the ergative case on the correct Bardi word. In each of the following Bardi sentences, one of the words
    is missing the ergative case. Use the interlinear glosses and the free translations to figure out which word
    should be marked.

```
**4. Causal ergatives**
    The suffix - _nim_ , in addition to marking ergative case, also appears in special sentences to mark an
    argument that is a semantic cause. It is attached to the noun that denotes the cause, as in:
    _Aalga-nim nga-nga-marra._
    sun-ERG 1 SG-PST-burn
    ‘I am burnt.’ (lit. I burnt because of the sun.)
    Note that the verb does not agree with this argument, but instead agrees with the semantic patient.
    A set of verbs in Bardi use this frame (ergative-marked CAUSE; patient as a subject of the verb). Here are
    two more examples:
    **a.** _Iiga-nim alig nga-n-da-n._
       sickness-ERG hurt 1 SG-TR-do-CONT
       ‘I’m sick.’
    **b.** _Banyjoordoo-nim boonyja aarli i-nga-rr-jimbi-na._
       fish.poison-ERG all fish 3 - PST-PL-die-REM.PST
       ‘All the fish died from the fish poison.’
    Is it best to analyze these examples as transitive or intransitive? Provide an analysis that:
    **i.** specifies whether these clauses are intransitive or transitive;
    **ii.** specifies arguments as either core or oblique;
    **iii.** explains the agreement and case-marking facts.

**527 Language Profile 9 Lowland Chontal**

```
No one knows exactly where Chontal speakers came from.
(Textbox LP9.1, which discusses the language name, explains in
part why this is so.) Our best estimates indicate they arrived in
Oaxaca sometime between 300 and 1000 AD. Recent figures from
the National Commission for the Development of Indigenous
Communities (CNDPI) indicate there are some 2,700 speakers of
Oaxaca Chontal in the region.
The language described in this profile is Lowland Chontal. It
is a highly endangered language, with perhaps a hundred flu-
ent first-language speakers who are quite elderly, and a much
larger number of semi-speakers, aged fifty and above. No chil-
dren learn Chontal as a first language and very few have access
to any type of bilingual education. The highland and lowland varieties of Chontal are not
mutually intelligible. There is relatively little contact between speakers of the two varieties,
due in part to social prejudice and in part to the fact that the two groups are no longer
major markets for each other.
```
```
9.2 Typological Profile
9.2.1 Morphological Type
Chontal is a predominantly synthetic language in that derivational and inflectional
morphemes bind to roots to form single words. The morphology is agglutinative ,
and most words are easily analyzable into recognizable mor-
phemes, which include roots, affixes, and clitics. Nominal
morphology is mostly prefixing, and verbal morphology is
mostly suffixing.
For example, the noun phrase ‘my little burro’ in (1) is a sin-
gle word in Chontal, with four prefixes before the noun root: a
```
### TEXTBOX LP9.1 WHAT’S IN A NAME?

```
The ethnic designation “Chontal” derives from a
word in the Nahuatl language, chontalli ‘stranger,’
used by the Aztecs to refer to any unfamiliar ethnic
group in ancient Meso-America. As a result, there
are or were a number of groups, speaking unrelated
languages, all called Chontal. Within Mexico, these are
distinguished by naming the state where the people
live today. Chontal of Tabasco is a Mayan language
still spoken in Tabasco, while Chontal of Guerrero is no
longer spoken by ethnic Chontal people in Guerrero.
Although there are “Chontal people” in all three
states, we have no reason to think they were once a
single community.
```
```
In the Chontalpa of Oaxaca, people refer to
themselves as Chontales and call their language
latyaygi , ‘the word.’
In Spanish, many people refer to the language
as el dialecto , ‘the dialect,’ a term which can carry
a pejorative sense. At first, many people I met in
Mexico responded with patient amusement to my
insistent corrections that Chontal is a language and
not a dialect. I unintentionally convinced even the
most skeptical by sending people postcards from the
United States written in Chontal. Friends reported that
this simple act was greeted with amazement and the
realization that Chontal is a real language.

The only obligatory affix on a Chontal verb is an inflectional suffix that describes the verb
action in such terms as perfective (complete), imperfective (incomplete), durative (ongoing
or habitual), or imperative (as a command). There are ten categories of verbal inflection in
Chontal. Suffixes have different shapes for singular versus plural subject, and the durative
suffix takes different forms according to the verb root. With the stem _sago_ -‘eat,’ the suffixes
for a singular subject are - _pa_ ‘perfective,’ ‘ _ma_ ‘imperfective,’ and - _duy_ ‘durative,’ as in (2).

```
(2) sago- ‘eat’ sagopa ‘ate’ completed action
sago’ma ‘eats’ incomplete action
sagoduy ‘eating’ ongoing or
habitual action
There are fourteen optional derivational suffixes that occur between the verb root and
the inflectional morphology. These include suffixes that signal the presence or absence of
certain participants and suffixes that describe qualities of the verb action, such as repeated,
distributed, or intensive. The clause ‘we heard it again’ can be expressed as a single word in
Chontal, as in (3).
```
**(3)** _tay-ko-kom-pa=yang_
hear-APPL-ITR-PFV=1PL.A
‘We heard it again.’
The applicative suffix indexes the ‘it’ that we heard; the iter-
ative suffix indicates that the hearing was repeated, and the
perfective suffix tells us the hearing was completed. The final
linguistic element in (3), marking the subject person ‘we,’ is a
clitic. There are many clitics in Chontal; these attach to nouns,
verbs, and very often to other clitics. Morpheme boundaries for
clitics are marked with an equal sign rather than a hyphen.

9.2.2 Syntactic Type

```
Chontal is a verb-initial language with variable constituent order. Most sentences in conver-
sation and narrative begin with the verb. If subjects (S) and objects (O) are mentioned, these
follow the verb, and usually the subject precedes the object. Example (4) has two clauses,
in VSO and VS order.
```
**(4)**

### SIDEBAR LP9.3

```
For more on clitics, see the Manange
Language Profile, Textbox LP3.5.
```
### VSOV S

```
‘oy’mi-‘me’ sayang lam-buru’ may-gom-’me’ sayang
pack-IPFV.PL 1 PL.ADET.PL-burro go-ITR-IPFV.PL 1 PL.A
‘We would pack the burros and get on the road again.’
```

**529 Language Profile 9 Lowland Chontal**

```
However, VSO and VS word orders are not obligatory. Any subject or object can precede
the verb if a speaker wants to highlight a certain participant. See how the speaker plays
with the focus in the excerpt in (5). The deer and the child are introduced in (a), then the
child is highlighted and the deer is not mentioned in (b), and the conclusion of the action
is described using the basic VS word order in (c).
```
```
(5) a. SV
ñulyi el venado joypa ñulye-pa pero
one DET deer already run-PFV.SG but
```
### SV

```
l-a-’wa jolaf’-a
DET-NOM-child sitting.above-STAT.SG
‘A deer ran with the child on its head (sitting above).’
```
```
b. OV
l-a-’wa-mulyi joypa chasa tye-’e-pa
DET-NOM-DIM-boy already now fall-CAUS-PFV.SG
‘Now it (the deer) dropped the little boy.’
```
```
c. VS
joypa tye-pa l-a-’wa-mulyi
already fall-PFV.SG DET-NOM-DIM-boy
‘And the little boy fell.’
```
```
A final important feature of Chontal morphosyntax is the case-marking system. In this
language, subjects and objects are marked according to seman-
tics of agentivity. To be “agentive” is to act with control and
intention; to be “non-agentive” is to experience something
beyond your control or intention. The relevant semantic case
roles are those of AGENT and PATIENT, and in every clause, core
participants are marked as agentive (A) or patientive (P), accord-
ing to the perceived level of control or intention of the partici-
pant over the event encoded by the verb.
This is easiest to illustrate with transitive and ditransitive clauses that involve multiple
participants. In (6) and (7), note how the person markers change in the two clauses, as I (A)
eat you (P), or you (A) give me (P) some bread.
```
### SIDEBAR LP9.4

roles , like AGENT and PATIENT, see
Section 6.3.5.
```

```
(7) jl-pay-pa=yma’ l-ay-’i
1 SG.P-give-PFV=2SG.A DET-1SG.POSS-bread
‘You gave me bread.’
```

**530 Loretta O’Connor**

```
We see the same types of differences with plural first- and second-person participants in
(8) and (9). We (A) see you (P), and you (A) say something to us (P).
```
```
(8) sim-p-olwa’ sa=yang
see-PFV-2PL.P DM=1PL.A
‘We saw you.’
```
```
(9) mi-p-onga’ sa=ymang
tell-PFV-1PL.P DM=2PL.A
‘You told us.’
The semantic differences are fairly transparent in multi-participant events, as one can judge
the relative agentivity of each participant with respect to the others. In each clause above, one
participant (the grammatical subject) was more agentive, marked as A, and another participant
(the grammatical direct or indirect object) was less agentive, and marked as P. The complete
paradigm of agent–patient morphology is shown in Table LP9.1, with allomorphs in paren-
theses. Markers in the A column can occur as independent pronouns or as clitics, and these
clitics can attach to verbs or to other clitics. Markers in the P column are strictly verbal affixes.
The lack of person markers for third persons, represented by zeroes in Table LP9.1, has
certain consequences. Look back at the excerpt in Example (5), and notice that none of
the verbs carries person-marking morphology. When all the participants are third-person
singular, the distinction between agents and patients is not expressed. We say the agent–
patient distinction is neutralized for this grammatical person/number. The distinction is
not neutralized for third-person plural, as shown in (10), with two clauses about burros. The
verb in (a) shows only that the subject is plural, seen in the infix - jl - and the plural form
of the imperfective suffix -‘ me ’, while the verb in (b) explicitly indicates that the subject is
both third-person plural and non-agentive, with the suffix - ilya ’.
```
**(10) a.** _tyijpe sa ñaño-jl-’me’ lam-buru_

```
```
Notice something unusual about Example (10): both clauses are intransitive, with just
one participant, yet the verbal person-marking morphology is different. This is a key feature
of the agentive system in Chontal: the single participant of an intransitive clause will be
marked as an agent or a patient according to the perceived level of control or intention of
the participant over the event encoded by the verb. In Examples (11)–(14), all the events in
(a) are controlled by the participants, while all the events in (b) are not.

### STOP AND REFLECT LP9.1 AGENTIVE AND NON-AGENTIVE PREDICATES

```
Look at the following list of intransitive predicates. For each one, decide how you would classify its subject:
as agentive or non-agentive. Is it always clear or are there ambiguous cases? What semantic classes do the
predicates fall into?
walk, dream, slip, fall asleep, shave, stand, collapse, fly, cough, go to bed, vomit, sweat, be tired, awaken, be hot,
be sad, swim, grow, dress, be grateful, be careful, jump, turn around, sneeze, trip, tremble, bloom
```
```
9.2.3 Phonological Type
The sound system of Chontal is composed of five vowels and thirty-three consonants. The
vowel inventory is quite simple, with five distinct phonemes a, e, i, o, u. Vowel length is
not phonemic, but it occurs in certain words, especially in penultimate stressed syllables.
These longer sounds are written with two vowels. There is one diphthong /ai/, written {ay}.
The consonant inventory is more complex, characterized by series of plain and glottal-
ized segments. In the practical orthography used here, the apostrophe represents both a
glottal stop and glottalization : k’, ts’, ch’, f’, s’, x’, jl’ are glottalized obstruents, and ‘ m, ‘n,
‘ñ, ‘l, ‘w are glottalized sonorants. The letter j represents both velar and glottal voiceless fric-
atives (i.e., [x] and [h] in the IPA), following a common orthographic practice from Spanish,
and the letter x represents a postalveolar voiceless fricative. Dialectal variants of the lateral
fricative segments jl, jl ’ are written tl, tl ’. Another prominent feature of Chontal phonology
is palatalization; see Textbox LP9.2.

```
### TEXTBOX LP9.2 PALATALIZATION

```
Most speakers of Lowland Chontal palatalize alveolar
segments before or after a high or front vowel /i, u/ or the
palatal approximant /y/. See Example (a), with possessed
forms of the body part anepo ’ ‘back,’ and notice how the
vowel of the possessive prefix determines the shape of the
determiner and the first consonant of the root.
a. l-o-nepo’
DET-2SG.POSS-back
‘your back’
ly-i-ñepo’
DET-3SG.POSS-back
‘his/her back’
l-ay-ñepo’
DET-1SG.POSS-back
‘my back’
```
```
Furthermore, when a verb root begins with an
alveolar consonant, that initial alveolar is palatalized
in third-person inflections, singular and plural. This
process creates alternations l~ly, n~ñ, s~x, ts~ch , and
t~ty , as in (b).
b. toj’me-duy=ya’
speak-DUR.SG= 1 SG.A
‘I’m speaking’
tyoj’me-duy
speak-DUR.SG
‘he/she is speaking’
The result is rampant palatalization, which is mostly
predictable, although it should be noted that some
speakers seem to palatalize alveolars in all words,
regardless of phonetic environment.
```
9.3 **Compound-Stem Predicates**

```
Chontal has a special complex verb construction called a compound-stem predicate. These
compound stems have one inflectional suffix and one set of core participants, and they can
predicate single- and multi-participant events.
```

**533 Language Profile 9 Lowland Chontal**

```
All compound-stem predicates encode change: change of location, change of position,
or change of state. When we talk about change, we talk about figures and grounds, terms
adapted from psychology. A figure is an entity that changes with respect to a ground , a
reference point or reference situation. In linguistics, the semantic case roles corresponding
to figures include actor, patient, experiencer , and theme. The semantic roles corresponding to
a ground include source and goal.
Compound stems consist of two types of verbal elements, each making an individual
contribution to the meaning of the construction. The basic template is as follows; VE stands
for “verbal element”:
```
```
VE1 – VE2 – (DERIVATION) – INFLECTION
```
```
Each type of element will be introduced separately, and then we will look at some exam-
ples of elements in combination, as compound stems. The initial verbal element, here
called VE1 , specifies one of the following:
```
```
tSomething about the figure
tits size, shape, type, position, or configuration
tSomething about the type of goal
tSomething about the change event itself
tthe process or cause that leads to change, or
tthe shape of the path taken by the figure in motion
```
```
These VE1 verbal elements fall into four semantic classes.
```
```
I. A “classificatory” VE1 identifies the shape, size, or identity of the figure as:
ch’u - ‘grain (especially corn)’ k’e - ‘liquid (especially water)’
le- ‘animate’ or ‘long and thin’ pe- ‘small’
soy- ‘shallow plate’ wa- ‘container’
The last morpheme in this list, wa - ‘container,’ can refer to the figure, such as a glass or a
plate that is moved, or it can also refer to the goal, as ‘into a container.’
```
```
II. A “dispositional” VE1 identifies the posture, spatial disposition, or configuration of the
figure with respect to the ground, as, for example:
jojl/jol/jola- ‘sit, sitting’ kas- ‘stand, standing’
ñaj- ‘lie, lying’ kuch’- ‘huddle, huddled over’
ño- ‘cross, crosswise’ k’o- ‘mouth (mouth-ward)’
spe- ‘spread, scattered’ sk’ing- ‘items in a circle’
III. A “means” VE1 describes something about the manner of how the change takes place. This
is a large category that includes:
cho- ‘spill’ te- ‘fall’ sk’wi- ‘stab’
fa- ‘plant’ fuj- ‘blow’ jas- ‘split, slice, tear’
jlay- ‘bend, break’ jli- ‘slide, slip’ jlo- ‘scoot’
kej- ‘cut, chop’ k’wa- ‘insert’ pes- ‘force’
```

**534 Loretta O’Connor**

### SIDEBAR LP9.5

```
For the definition of diachrony , see
Section 12.2.1 or the Glossary (at
the back of this book or online).
```
**IV.** A “trajectory” VE1 depicts the specific shape of the path taken by the figure in motion:

```
‘ oy - ‘flat arc’ s’wi- ‘arc back’ spa- ‘high arc’
ki- ‘straight, horizontal’ go- ‘back and forth’
The second element, the VE2 , specifies:
```
```
tthe direction of motion;
tthe endpoint of motion or position in space;
tthe end-state of a change of state, as “apart, in two pieces.”
```
```
-f’ ‘up’ -ay ‘across’
-ayj ‘down’ -ñi ‘across’
-’mi ‘in’ -f’i ‘upon’
-gi, -ki ‘out’ -may ‘down in’
-k’oy ‘inside’ -way, -we ‘down on’
There are approximately a hundred VE1 elements and about a dozen VE2 elements.
Not all combinations of VE1 and VE2 are allowed: there are about 175 compound-stem
predicates attested in the current corpus. Speakers must learn that some meanings can
combine but others cannot. For example, one can combine jway - ‘jump’ and - ñi ‘across’
into the compound stem jwayñi - ‘jump across,’ but we cannot
make similar constructions to express ‘run across,’ ‘swim across,’
or ‘dance across.’ Without written records of the language, we
have few clues as to the diachronic processes that produced
compound stems. For now, we have to assume that these con-
structions reflect meaningful combinations that have been used
more frequently and have somehow been more useful to speakers over time. Some of this
“usefulness” is suggested in the description of compound-stem predicates exemplified in
the sections below.
```
9.3.1 Means Predicates: Manner of Motion, Manner of Change

```
Details of how a change happens can be provided with a “means” construction, based on
a means VE1. Examples (15) and (16) both talk about ways to put seed into the earth, with
the same figure (the seeds), and the same goal (the earth). The difference between the two is
the manner of moving the seeds. In (15), the farmer will broadcast (i.e., loosely throw) the
seeds into the field, and the verb begins with faj - ‘plant, sow.’
```
**(15)** (^) _faj -’mi -’ma sa layñega_
plant-in-IPFV.SG DM cornfield
VE1 VE2
‘He will sow the cornfield.’
In contrast, in (16), the motion is more controlled, as a few kernels of corn are carefully
dropped into the prepared ground.


**535 Language Profile 9 Lowland Chontal**

```
(16) tye’-’mi-’ma sa fane la’wa-kosak’
drop-in-IPFV.SG DM three little-corn
VE1 VE2
‘He will trickle in three corn kernels (into the furrow).’
These ‘planting’ examples demonstrate different manners of motion. A means VE1 can
also distinguish a particular type of state change, including the different qualities of the
result of a stage change. The next three examples all describe ways to separate an object
into more than one piece. The VE1 jas - ‘tear, split’ is used when the figure is cloth or paper.
(17) jas-ñi-pa=yma’ el je’e
tear-across-PFV.SG=2SG.ADET paper
‘You ripped the paper apart.’
The VE1 ski - means to ‘split or divide something cleanly in two,’ whether a piece of kin-
dling or a crowd of people or, as in (18), a piece of fruit.
```
**(18)** (^) _ski-ñi-pa=yma’ el mangu_
split-across-PFV.SG=2SG.ADET mango
‘You split the mango in two.’
And the VE1 _pay_ - ‘break, shatter’ is used when the figure is hard or brittle and therefore
likely to break into more than one piece.
**(19)** _pay-ni-pa=yma’ la’i pedazo pedazo pedazo_
break-across-PFV.SG=2SG.A bread piece piece piece
‘You broke apart the bread into pieces.’

### STOP AND REFLECT LP9.2 SEPARATING OBJECTS INTO PIECES

```
Look at the structure of the English translations in Examples (17) through (19), then think of other situations
where things are broken apart and how you would phrase them in English. In what part of the lexicon and the
clause are such meanings expressed? How about in other languages that you are familiar with?
```
```
9.3.2 Classificatory Predicates: Referent Introduction and Tracking
Compound verbs can do more than just create new verbs with more detailed meaning.
They can also be used in discourse to clarify the identity of referents. For example, in (20),
the VE1 classificatory element indexes the size of the figure (the bag), clarifying that the
speaker is referring to the small backpack, as opposed to another bag.
(20) tyinchi maa=yma’ p-ayj-pa l-o-bolsa
why NEG=2SG.A small-down-PFV.SG DET-2SG.POSS-bag
‘Why don’t you take off your backpack?’
In (21), the VE1 classificatory element identifies the figure as a grain, likely corn or rice.
```
```
(21) ch’uj-’mi-’ma=yma’ ten sa=yma’ majkoda
grain-in-IPFV=2SG.A what DM=2SG.A cook
‘You put in whatever grain you want to cook.’
```

```
536 Loretta O’Connor
```
```
In Example (22), from conversation, the VE1 classificatory element indicates to the addressee
which item in the shared context should be picked up.
(22) wa-f’-jla’ jay
container-up-IMP.SG female.friend
‘Pick that up, girlfriend (a plate, a glass, a bowl, a basket).’
```
```
Argument omission or ellipsis is very common in Chontal,
and the use of classificatory compound-stem predicates is a
useful strategy for introducing referents, tracking referents in
discourse, and maintaining a background participant in the dis-
course frame without using a noun phrase.
```
### SIDEBAR LP9.6

```
For a discussion of referent tracking
in discourse, see Textbox 9.3.
```
```
9.3.3 Dispositional Predicates: Spatial Precision and Referent Tracking
Dispositional predicates, with dispositional VE1s, can give rich detail about the spatial con-
figuration of the figure after a change of position, as, for example, ‘mouthward upon’ (23)
or ‘sitting down in’ (24).
```
### SIDEBAR LP9.7

See Section 14.8.3 for more insight
on the type of discourse context in
which ellipsis occurs.

```
(23) k’o-ma-f’i-yuy iya’ l-i-tapadera l-ay-k’ejwa’
mouth-x-up.on-DUR.SGlSG.ADET-3SG.POSS-lid DET-1SG.POSS-well
‘I put/am putting a lid on my well.’
```
```
(24) jojl-may-pa lapixu’ maj-lixpantalek-’ej
sitting-down.in-PFV.SG pot LOC-forked.branch-tree
‘The pot was sitting in the crotch of the tree.’
Other dispositional VE1s depict a more abstract arrangement of
the figure. The element sk’ing - ‘items in a circle’ describes the place-
ment of multiple figures into a circle, such as when dealing cards or
doling out food, drink, or money. In (25), the speaker related how
workers would come in from the fields and sit down around big
bowls of food for the midday meal.
```
```
(25) xago-’me’ lakujlwe’ , xk’ing-we-’me’ lamats’
eat-IPFV.PL man.PL items.in.circle-down.on-IPFV.PL earth
‘The men are going to eat, so they sit in a circle on the ground.’
```
```
In addition, dispositional predicates play a minor role in referent tracking. Example
(26) illustrates this function. There is no noun phrase that mentions the figure argument,
the body of the deceased. Instead, the dispositional element ñaj - ‘lying’ tracks the figure
as ‘a lying thing’ that is moved from the small mat used during a visitation into a casket
for burial.
```
```
(26) tyijpe sa ñaj-f’-’mi-pa’ jaape li-kaja
DIST DM lying-up-in-PFV.PL where 3 SG.POSS-coffin
‘There they picked him up and put him in his coffin.’
```

**537 Language Profile 9 Lowland Chontal**

```
Example (26) also demonstrates that some compound stems combine two VE2 elements
to depict an elaborated trajectory of motion, here, ‘up’ and then ‘in.’
```
```
9.3.4 Trajectory Predicates: Elaborated Path of Motion
Only a few compound-stem predicates in my corpus depict an elaborated path of motion
by stacking VE2 elements as a series of endpoints, as in (26). More commonly, a trajectory
VE1 is used to describe different shapes of the trajectory of movement.
In (27), a figure is placed on top of a ground by moving it in a flat arc: here, a person
places a saddle on the back of a burro.
```
```
Figure LP9.5 Scene from a Chontal sugar cane parade
```
```
(27) ‘oy-f’i-’ma sa=ya’ l-ay-buru
flat.arc-up.on-IPFV.SG DM=lSG.ADET-lSG.POSS-burro
‘I will saddle my burro.’
```
```
In (28), chili seedlings (the figure) are removed from a bucket, moving in a different type
of arc up over the edge of the bucket, to be planted in a field.
```
```
(28) xpa-gi-’ma sage=l kasi para sa fa-’ma
high.arc-out-IPFV DM=DET chili to DM plant-IPFV
‘He would transplant the chili to plant it.’
And finally, the trajectory element ki - depicts a path that projects in a straight line, as
in (29).
```

**538 Loretta O’Connor**

**(29)** _joypa sa=yma’ ki-ñi-pa el puente de Piña_

‘Now you’ve crossed the Piña bridge.’

```
This overview of compound-stem predicates in Lowland Chontal gives a taste of the
complex meanings they convey. The same types of verb are found in Highland Chontal,
although these have not been described. Intriguingly, the compound stem may provide
a window into the prehistory of the Chontal people. This construction is not found in
southern Mexico outside the Oaxaca Chontal family but is well attested in languages that
are or were spoken in present-day Oregon, California, Arizona, and northwestern Mexico.
A thorough comparison of compound stems in all of these languages may help us under-
stand any areal or genetic connections between the languages and among the people who
spoke them.
```
### CHAPTER SUMMARY

```
This language profile has highlighted a number of interesting typological features of
Lowland Chontal of Oaxaca, including extensive glottalization and palatalization, a
synthetic, agglutinative morphology, flexibility in the ordering of syntactic constituents,
and agent–patient participant marking. In addition, it has shown that compound-stem
predicates in this marvelous language provide rich resources for encoding change, giving
precise detail of spatial disposition, physical qualities of the figure, and the manner of
change. The endangered status of the language and the difficulties of revitalization mean
that the scope and nuance of the grammar of change in Chontal may disappear with the
last fluent speakers. Documentation of endangered languages is vital to our understanding
of the diversity of the human mind and the record of human history.

### EXERCISES

**1.** Agent–patient systems, sometimes called agentive or active–static systems, are found in languages all over
    the world. This grammatical system represents a type of “semantic alignment” because core participants
    are marked according to a semantic motivation.
       Agentive languages and active–static languages differ with respect to what motivates the different types
    of marking. Agentive languages like Chontal tend to respond to semantic features of agentivity, understood
    as control, volition, or intention, while active–static languages tend to use one set of markers for events
    (active) and one set for states (static).
       What these grammatical systems have in common is that, formally, they treat the single argument
    of intransitive verbs (S) sometimes like the subject of transitive verbs (A) and sometimes like the object
    (O) of transitive verbs. Therefore, we say that agentive and active systems treat some S arguments like
    A arguments and other S arguments like O arguments. (These are sometimes referred to informally as
    “Split-S” systems.)
       A speaker of an agentive language like Chontal answers several questions in each description of change
    (e.g., Did the participant cause the change? Did he or she control it, or did it happen involuntarily? Was the
    change a surprise?). Some languages permit both types of marking on individual verbs, to encode differences
    such as _drinking_ versus _getting drunk_ and _falling asleep_ versus _fainting_.
       Consider each of the following pairs of sentences. In each case, the (a) member of the pair is in agentive
    form, while the (b) member of the pair is in patientive form. What is the likely difference in meaning or
    implication between each pair? Give an example of situations in which a speaker might use each one.
    Explain your reasoning.

**LANGUAGE PROFILE 10**

Manambu

10.1 **Introduction**

```
The island of New Guinea is probably the most linguistically diverse and complex area in
the world, with over 1,000 languages spoken in an area of 900,000 square kilometers. About
300 to 400 languages belong to the Austronesian language family. Other, non- Austronesian,
languages are called “Papuan” (Foley 1986: 1; Aikhenvald and Stebbins 2007). This rough
denomination covers over sixty linguistic families and a fair number of linguistic isolates
spoken in the area. Within New Guinea itself, the Sepik River basin (which includes East Sepik
and West Sepik, or Sandaun, provinces), with its 200 languages, is the most linguistically

```
diverse. Of the several language families of the Sepik (including
the Lower Sepik, Ramu, Sepik Hill, Kwoma-Nukuma, and Tama
families), the Ndu family is the largest in terms of both the num-
ber of speakers and the territory over which it extends, from the
Sepik River itself northwards to the coast (Roscoe 1994).
Manambu is a member of the Ndu language family. About
2,500 people speak Manambu in four villages in the East Sepik
Province (Ambunti district) along the Sepik River: Avatip,
renowned as the most traditional village and a sort of Manambu “metropolis”; Malu, the
place where the first contact with Europeans took place early in the twentieth century;
Yambon, or Yuanab; and Yawabak (see Figure LP10.2). Not more than 200–400 Manambu
speakers live in scattered expatriate communities in major cities of Papua New Guinea,
including Port Moresby, Wewak, Lae, Madang, Kokopo, and Mount Hagen. Because of the
complex language contact situation, the Manambu language is considered to be endan-
gered (see Textbox LP10.1).
```
### SIDEBAR LP10.1

```
The online resources for this
language profile include a glossed
and translated Manambu text, with
audio files and photos of the speaker,
and a short speaker biography
```
### TEXTBOX LP10.1 HOW VITAL IS MANAMBU?

```
Just like many other indigenous languages in Papua
New Guinea, Manambu has hardly any monolingual
speakers. Most children acquire Tok Pisin, the local
lingua franca , as their first language, using it in
their day-to-day communication. School education
is conducted in Papua New Guinea English. The
Manambu language can therefore be considered
endangered.
Both Tok Pisin and Manambu are used at home and
also in some rituals which are still performed, albeit in
a reduced form (compared to what was documented
earlier). Tok Pisin is dominant in village meetings,
parent–teacher meetings at school, and in church
(where Manambu is also used, but to a limited extent).
That is, Tok Pisin and Manambu are in a partially
diglossic situation. The necessity for proficiency in Tok
```
```
Pisin is enhanced by the number of outsiders living in
the villages, mostly as a result of mixed marriages.
However, the prospects for Manambu’s survival
may not be that dismal. The role models of returning
urban Manambu – and the power and enduring value
of cultural knowledge conceived as the knowledge of
important words and totemic and personal names – are
what may ensure that the language lives on. Tok
Pisin and Papua New Guinea English are there to
stay, as languages of the outside power and authority
conceptualized as attributes of the “white man’s”
world. But neither of these intruders appears to shatter
the position of Manambu as the language of spiritual
and symbolic power, which, in this Sepik culture,
is most valued. Manambu remains an emblematic
language for the people it “belongs” to, and the
traditional owners are determined to pass it on.
```

multilingualism and diglossia, see
Section 11.2.3.
```
```
In terms of its grammatical structure, Manambu is one of the
most complex languages in the Ndu family. The relative com-
plexity of Manambu can be partially accounted for by language
contact. The Manambu incorporated into their community
members of neighboring tribes whom they had conquered as a
result of inter-tribal warfare (Harrison 1993; Aikhenvald 2009).
These outsiders spoke different languages and as they learned Manambu they did so imper-
fectly, bringing in features of their own native speech. Some of these features eventually
spread through the entire Manambu community, creating a substrate effect.

We now turn to a few salient features of the language. First
we present a brief snapshot of Manambu’s linguistic type and
some typological features. We then discuss one of the key issues
in Manambu grammar: the marking of grammatical relations on
verbs and on nouns.

10.2 The Linguistic Features of Manambu
10.2.1 Phonology
Manambu has twenty-one consonants and nine vowels, more
than any other language of the Ndu family. These are shown
in Tables LP10.1 and LP10.2. An interesting Ndu phonological
feature is discussed in Textbox LP10.2.
Stress is contrastive: it may distinguish words with different
meanings. Minimal pairs are ák ə s , a particle indicating habitual
negation, and ak əࡾ s ‘catch!’, g ə rñ əࡾ r ‘to tail’ and g əࡾ ñ ə r ‘later.’
```
### SIDEBAR LP10.4

```
The orthography for Manambu
follows the IPA except for the
transcription of palato-alveolar and
palatal consonants. As in many
orthographic systems, the letter j
indicates the postalveolar affricate,
y indicates the palatal glide, and ñ
indicates the palatal nasal. These are
shown in Table LP10.1.

### TEXTBOX LP10.2 PRENASALIZED STOPS

```
Manambu shares an interesting phonological feature
with many Papuan and Austronesian languages of
this area: voiced stops and the voiced affricate are
prenasalized in syllable-initial position. So, the word for
```
```
‘man’ /du/, is pronounced as [ndu]. Incidentally, this
root is shared by all the Ndu languages and is the name
given to the whole family.
```
```
10.2.2 Morphology
As discussed in Chapter 4, languages can be classified based on their degrees of fusion
and degrees of synthesis. Manambu can be described as synthetic , that is, allowing many
```

**546 Alexandra Y. Aikhenvald and Carol Genetti**

```
morphemes per word. The language is also agglutinating , so it is relatively easy to deter-
mine the boundaries between morphemes, although there is some fusion. Most grammati-
cal morphemes are suffixes. There are just two prefixes: the valency-increasing kay- , which
will be discussed below, and the second-person imperative a -.
```
10.2.3 Word Classes: Nouns

```
The major word classes in Manambu, nouns and verbs, are both open classes. The two are
clearly distinguished, as they have different grammatical categories and different inflec-
tional possibilities.
```
### TEXTBOX LP10.3 CLASSIFICATORY FATHERS

```
Each Manambu person has more than one man whom
they address as asa:y ‘father.’ One uses this term for a
biological father, and also for one’s father’s brothers –
that is, ‘paternal uncles.’ These are called “classificatory
fathers.” A child belongs to the same clan as their
```
```
classificatory father. A son would learn traditional lore
and family history from one of his fathers and listen to
their advice. In addition, names – which are considered
a prized possession among the Manambu – are
inherited from one’s classificatory fathers.
```
```
Beginning with nouns, nominal categories include two gen-
ders (masculine and feminine), three numbers (singular, dual ,
and plural), nine case forms, and a number of derivations.
Number is usually realized through agreement on modifiers
and on the verb. For example, consider the noun phrase k ə -
di ya:p (PROX.DEM-PL rope) ‘these ropes,’ which is taken from
Example (7) below. The proximal demonstrative stem k ə ‘this’
takes a plural suffix reflecting the plurality of the head noun.
(Similarly, the demonstrative these is plural in English.) Number
marking is found on only some nouns. Kinship terms, includ-
ing the word for ‘child’ ñau , and a handful of nouns from other semantic groups (such as
kudi ‘mouth’), are marked for number, e.g., asa:y ‘father,’ asay-v ə ti (father-DU) ‘two clas-
sificatory fathers’ (see Textbox LP10.3), asay-ugw (father-PL) ‘many classificatory fathers.’
The noun ñan ‘child’ has a semi-suppletive form ñ ə di for the dual number, and a plural
ñan-ugw ‘children.’
A special type of plural can be marked on personal names. This is referred to as an asso-
ciative plural. It refers to a group of two or more people associated with the person who
is named. Thus, Tanina-b ə r (Tanina-ASSOC.NSG) may mean ‘Tanina and one other person,’ or
two altogether, in which case this form requires dual agreement on modifiers and on the
verb. In Example (1), agreeing elements are underlined.
```
### SIDEBAR LP10.5

```
In Example (1), you will notice
that the associative non-singular
and the dual marker in Manambu
are homonyms. This is accidental;
they are not etymologically related,
as each has a different Proto-Ndu
etymology (see Aikhenvald 2008:
594–595).
```

### SIDEBAR LP10.7

```
To read about a language with a
system of four genders , see the Tsez
Language Profile, Section LP7.3.1.
```
### SIDEBAR LP10.6

```
To review the terms proximal
and distal for demonstratives, see
Section 5.8 or the Glossary.
```
```
(1) a-b ə r Tanina-b ə r wakuna-b ə r
DIST.DEM-DU Tanina-ASSOC.NSG go.out-3DU
‘Those two, Tanina and one other person, are going out’
```
```
The same form Tanina-bΩr can refer to Tanina and more than
one person, i.e., more than two altogether. In such cases, plural
agreement markers appear on the modifiers – such as the plural
distal demonstrative a-di in Example (2) – and on the verb:
```
```
(2) a-di Tanina-b ə r wakuna-di
DIST.DEM-PL Tanina-ASSOC.NSG go.out-3PL
‘Those several/many, Tanina and other people, are going out’
```
```
Gender is marked in independent pronouns and in pronom-
inal suffixes on the verb. But it is only distinguished for the
second- and third-person singular categories; the distinction is
neutralized (not made) in the non-singular numbers – the dual
and the plural. Each noun is assigned masculine or feminine gen-
der. In the noun phrase, modifiers (including demonstratives,
interrogatives, possession markers, and three of the adjectives)
agree with the gender of the head noun; there is gender agreement in the verb as well.
For the majority of nouns, gender is not expressed on the noun itself, that is, one can-
not determine the gender of a noun simply by looking at its form (as is true with much of
the vocabulary of Romance languages). The only exception is personal names – a highly
salient subgroup of nouns in Manambu that are also considered tantamount to monetary
valuables, those whose ownership is disputed in name debates (see Textbox LP10.4). Most
personal names have masculine and feminine counterparts, which are distinguished mor-
phologically; for example, the male name Kigin ə b ə k has a female counterpart KiginΩb ə k ə -
b ə r. Some male personal names contain the morpheme du ‘man,’ e.g., Kawi-du , while
some female personal names contain ta:kw ‘woman,’ e.g., Ñamamayra-ta:kw.
Nouns are assigned genders according to the sex of a human referent, and to the shape
and size of a referent of any other semantic group. That is, men are assigned to the mascu-
line, and women to the feminine gender. A large dog or a large house is treated as masculine,
and a small dog or a small house as feminine. Many speakers are aware of the correlation
between gender assignment and size: a-d ə wuua-d ə wi (DIST.DEM-SG.M 1 SG-SG.M house) ‘that
(masculine) house of mine’ – referring to a big house I own – may be translated as ‘that big
man-type house of mine.’ Conversely, a-Ø wuua-Ø wi (DIST.DEM-SG.F 1 SG-SG.F house) ‘that
(feminine) house of mine’ – referring to a small house I own – may well be translated as
‘that small woman-type house of mine.’ Round objects, such as ab ‘head,’ gwas ‘turtle,’ or
ya:l ‘belly,’ are normally feminine. But a belly of an unusually large size can be referred to
with the masculine form of a modifier.
```

**548 Alexandra Y. Aikhenvald and Carol Genetti**

### TEXTBOX LP10.4 THE VALUE OF NAMES

```
Manambu culture differs dramatically from those of
Western societies. For example, the Manambu people
place particular importance on ownership of personal
names, and totemic names belonging to the major clan
groups and their subclans. Possessing multiple names
is viewed as a major asset. Ritual debates concerning
```
```
name ownership are, traditionally, the main political
forum and the center of village life. For a detailed
ethnographic study of the Manambu, see Harrison
(1990, 1993 ). For another cultural note related to
counting, see Textbox LP10.6.
```
```
A ritual name debate
```
```
Assigning a gender to a mass noun depends on the amount of the referent: money can
be referred to as masculine when talking about a large sum; a small sum is referred to with
feminine gender. A not-too-dark night is feminine; if a night is completely dark, it becomes
masculine. The word ka:m ‘hunger’ is treated as masculine if one is very hungry, and as
feminine if one just wants a snack. A further important function of gender is to distinguish
polysemous nouns. For instance, ma:m ‘older sibling’ can refer either to an elder brother or
to an elder sister; gender is instrumental for disambiguating the reference.
By semantic extension, an unusually big or bossy woman can be treated as masculine,
and a squat fattish man as feminine. The word ab ‘head’ typically requires feminine agree-
ment, because of its round shape. But if one is suffering from a severe headache, one can
say ‘my-masculine head is hurting’ – this is because the head then feels unusually big and
heavy.
```

**549 Language Profile 10 Manambu**

```
10.2.4 Word Classes: Verbs
Some Manambu verbs are either strictly intransitive or strictly transitive. Strictly intransi-
tive verbs include motion verbs, e.g., yi - ‘go,’ ya - ‘come,’ g ə p - ‘run,’ and a few others, such
as parki - ‘be torn.’ A few verbs can be used only transitively, e.g., yi - ‘say, speak’ and kur - ‘do,
make, get.’ There are few ditransitive verbs, e.g., kwatiya - ‘give to a non-third person,’ kui -
‘give to third person,’ and derivations based on this. However, over 80 percent of verbs in
Manambu are ambitransitive : they can be used either transitively or intransitively, in a
similar way to English eat : in its transitive use, it requires an object (e.g., I have eaten dinner );
in its intransitive use, no object appears (e.g., I have eaten already ).
Ambitransitive verbs in Manambu include ingestive verbs k ə- ‘consume (food, drink,
smoke)’ and j ə- ‘chew,’ and verbs of cognition wuk ə- ‘hear, obey, understand’ and laku -
‘know, understand.’ The verb rali(na) - ‘untie, be untied’ is among the few ambitransitive
verbs of the type similar to English break , as in I have broken a glass and A glass broke. This
represents one of two types of ambitransitive verbs, where the subject of the intransitive
clause ( glass in a glass broke ) corresponds to the object of the transitive clause (I have broken
a glass ). We will call this type of ambitransitive S.of.I=O.of.T. The other type of ambitran-
sitive verb is exemplified by English eat. Here the subject of the intransitive clause ( I ate .)
corresponds to the subject of the transitive ( I ate a sandwich ). This type will be referred to
as S.of.I=S.of.T. Moving back to Manambu rali(na) , Examples (3) and (4) illustrate that this
is the S.of.I=O.of.T type.
```
```
(3) Intransitive
```
```
[ wun-a kwa:r ]SUBJ (ka:p) ralina

[ wuna - ø kwa:r ]OBJ ralina-wun
1 SG.SG.F grass.skirt untie-1SG.F.NPST
‘I untied/have untied my grass skirt’
```
```
The prefix kay - derives a transitive verb from an intransitive verb. The intransitive verb
pΩrki(na) - ‘be torn’ is shown in Example (5).
```
```

```
```

In Example (6), the verb ‘be torn’ is transitivized.

```
```
‘This naughty girl (fully) tore my clothing’
```
### TEXTBOX LP10.5 CAUSATIVE CONSTRUCTIONS

```
Causative constructions are ways of expressing a
caused event. The causative construction illustrated in
(6) represents the most common type: morphological
causation. In morphological causatives there is a
causative morpheme, like kay - in Manambu, that is
affixed to the verb. Most commonly in the world’s
languages, causative constructions increase the
transitivity of the verb by one degree so that intransitive
```
```
verbs become transitive, and transitive verbs become
ditransitive. They thus involve the introduction of a new
core argument, the semantic causer, which is treated
as the agentive core argument (i.e., the A). The single
core argument of the corresponding intransitive clause
(S) becomes the O of the derived transitive, as with the
argument wuna ku-su-wapwi ‘my clothing’ in Examples
(5) and (6).
```
### TEXTBOX LP10.6 THE CULTURAL RELEVANCE OF COUNTING

```
The Manambu language has a decimal counting
system. Proficient speakers can count up to a hundred
using Manambu terms. In traditional times, counting
was an established cultural practice: male prowess
was estimated on the basis of how many enemies a
```
```
man had killed, and so it was customary to count the
victims, as a matter of competition. Nowadays, Tok
Pisin and English numbers are used more and more
often, especially in counting money.
```
```
This prefix kay - occurs with about a hundred verbs referring to states and processes (the
most frequently used ones are listed in Aikhenvald 2008: 407). Derived transitive verbs
containing kay - are strictly transitive.
The prefix kay - can also occur on several dozen ambitransitive and transitive verbs, all
of them verbs of manipulation. With these verbs, it does not function as a causative (see
Textbox LP10.5) and does not increase the transitivity by one degree. Instead, its effects are
as follows:
```
**1.** It converts any ambitransitive verb into a strictly transitive one. That is, the transitivity
    status of the verb is affected. However, _kay_ - does not make such a verb into a causative, i.e.,
    it does not introduce a new “causer.”
**2.** The semantic effect of _kay_ - on transitive and ambitransitive verbs implies an increase in
    manipulative effort, intentionality, volitionality, and control on the part of the subject (A),
    and may also imply that the object (O) is multiple or large.


**551 Language Profile 10 Manambu**

```
Consider the ambitransitive verb rali(ua) - ‘untie, be untied,’ which was introduced in
Examples (3) and (4). In (7), the same verb is used with the prefix kay -. The ropes are tan-
gled, and untying them requires special effort:
```
```
(7) ya:n k ə -di ya:p a-rali a-kay-rali
come.SEQ PROX.DEM-PL rope IMP-untie IMP-MANIP-untie
‘Come and untie these ropes; untie them with special effort (since they are entangled)’
```
```
This causative-manipulative polysemy is rather uncommon cross-linguistically. It is remi-
niscent of similar patterns described for Oceanic languages (Harrison 1982; Dixon 1988),
which are also spoken in the Pacific region. To compare causative constructions in English,
see Stop and Reflect LP10.1.
```
### STOP AND REFLECT LP10.1 CREATING CAUSATIVES IN ENGLISH

```
English does not have a causative affix like -kay but has other means for signaling causation. For each of the
English intransitive verbs below, think of a corresponding transitive predicate with a causative meaning that
includes a new core argument, the causer (e.g., be hot has a corresponding transitive predicate heat , as in the
soup is hot and he heated the soup ). How many strategies does English use and how would you describe them?
Can you use more than one strategy for any of these verbs? If so, is there a difference in meaning and how
would you characterize it?
eat, die, be afraid, be famished, be tired, sleep, jump, sneeze, laugh
```
```
Verbal inflectional categories cover three persons, two genders (distinguished in second
and third person), three numbers, and a variety of aspects. Among the various modal mean-
ings are the “frustrative” (‘intend but fail to do’), the purposive ‘intend,’ and the desidera-
tive ‘want,’ as shown in Example (8).
```
```
(8) wun kami: k ə -kar
1 SG fish consume-DESIDERATIVE
‘I want to eat fish’
```
```
A verb in the declarative mood can cross-reference the person, number, and gender of
the subject. If a clause contains a constituent that is more topical than the subject, this
constituent can also be cross-referenced alongside the subject. This will be discussed more
fully below.
As we will see, past and non-past tenses are fused with person-marking suffixes, while
future and irrealis are marked with suffixes. Most verbs take directional markers, specifying
whether the movement follows an upward, a downward, or an outward direction, toward
the speaker or away from them. A verbal root can be reduplicated to express intensive,
continuous, or repeated action.
Verbs are productively combined with each other to specify
the manner or a sequence of actions, such as v æ s ə -piñ ə- (step-
slip) ‘slip stepping,’ or g ə p ə -wula - (run-go.inside) ‘go inside
by running.’ Some verbs have taken on grammatical mean-
ings when combined with other verbs (i.e., they have become

grammaticalized): the verb t ə p -‘to be closed’ acquired the meaning of ‘do for the last time,’
as in v ə -t ə p - (see-be.closed) ‘see for the last time,’ and the verb wa - ‘say, speak’ developed
into a causative marker, as in yaga - ‘be scared,’ wa-yaga - ‘make (someone) scared.’
```
10.2.5 Adjectives

```
Manambu has two subclasses of adjectives. Both are closed classes that do not admit new mem-
bers. One subclass consists of just three members: kwasa ‘small,’ numa ‘big,’ and yara ‘fine.’
These adjectives always agree with the noun in gender and in number, e.g., numa-d ə du (big-SG.M
man) ‘big man,’ numa ta:kw (big-SG.F woman) ‘big woman,’ numa-di du (big-PL man) ‘big men.’
The other subclass has about sixteen members, covering meanings of value (e.g., vyak ə t ə ‘good’,
kuprap ə ‘bad’), size (e.g., g ə rg ə r ‘tiny,’ s ə mi ‘long’), and color (e.g., gla ‘black,’ wama ‘white,’ ñiki
‘red’). These adjectives do not agree with the noun they modify but have a single form, regard-
less of the gender and number of the noun, e.g., vyak ə t ə du ‘good man,’ vyak ə t ə ta:kw ‘good
woman.’ Many of these adjectives are transparently related to nouns: for instance, ñiki ‘red’ is
also the word for blood, and wama ‘white’ is derived from wa:m ‘white cockatoo’ (a type of bird).
```
10.2.6 Personal Pronouns

```
Personal pronouns are a closed word class (the full set is given in Table LP10.3). The cate-
gories of number (singular, dual, plural), gender (masculine, feminine), and person (first,
second, third) are all distinguished. However, they are not maximally distinguished; there
are not distinct forms for every logically possible combination of these three categories. We
can analyze the distribution of categories as follows:
```
```
tNumber is distinguished in all forms. One can always tell from the pronoun whether the
referent is singular, dual, or plural.
tGender is only distinguished in the second- and third-person singular. Gender distinc-
tions are neutralized (i.e., not made) in the first-person singular and in all non-singular
(dual and plural) categories.
tThree persons are distinguished in the singular and plural. The distinction between sec-
ond person and third person is neutralized in the dual; i.e., there is only one marker for
all non-first persons in the dual.
```
```
Note how the structure of Table LP10.3 reflects the pattern of these distinctions.
```
```

**553 Language Profile 10 Manambu**

```
10.2.7 Demonstratives
Demonstratives are the most complex of the closed word classes. They distinguish five
directions – up, down, across, outwards, and inside or away from the Sepik River – in addi-
tion to three additional degrees of distance.
The three demonstrative stems are k ə- ‘this, close to speaker,’ wa - ‘this, close to hearer,’
and a - ‘that, far from both speaker and hearer.’ Each of these stems can combine with one
of five directional suffixes, wur ‘up, upstream,’ - d(a) ‘down, downstream,’ - aki ‘across,’ - aku
‘outwards’ or - wula ‘inside, away from the Sepik River toward the shore.’ For example, a
Manambu speaker refers to stars, which are far up in the sky, as k ə -di-a-wur kugar (PROX.DEM-
PL-LINKER-UP star) ‘those stars (up),’ and a village close to the speaker away from the Sepik
River is referred to as k ə -d-a-wula t ə p (PROX.DEM-SG.M-LINKER-AWAY.FROM.RIVER village) ‘this
village away from the Sepik River.’
```
```
10.2.8 Clause Combining and Switch Reference
Similar to many other languages of New Guinea, Manambu has extensive clause-chaining ,
a construction that creates chains of clauses by using a special set of suffixes on the verbs
in the non-final clauses in the chain, and then fully inflecting
the verb in the final clause of the chain. In addition, and again
like many other languages of the area, Manambu has a complex
system of switch reference , whereby the clause-chaining suf-
fixes indicate whether the subject of the clause is the same as, or
different from, that of the main clause. Example (9) illustrates a
chain of two clauses. The suffix - ku on the verb of the first clause
is a clause-chaining suffix. In addition to forming the chain, it
marks two other grammatical meanings: that the action of the
non-main clause is completed, and that its subject is the same as that of the main clause.
Note that in same-subject chained clauses (e.g., the first clause of (9)), the person of the
subject is not marked on the verb. Clause boundaries are indicated with square brackets.
```
```
‘After he (Iraman) had made those designs, he (Kawidu) went off’
```
### SIDEBAR LP10.9

```
Also see the South Conchucos
Quechua Language Profile, Textbox
LP6.5, for another example of a
language with a switch-reference
system.
```
```
(9) [ a-di j ə b kur-ku ][ ata ya:d ]
DIST.DEM-PL design make-COMPL.SS then go.3SG.M.PST
‘Having made those designs, he went off’
```
```
In contrast, in Example (10) the subjects of the chained clause and the main clause are
different. The predicate of the non-main clause contains a person marker (- d ə-, which indi-
cates third-person masculine singular) followed by the clause-chaining suffix - k , which indi-
cates both that the action of the chained clause is completed and that we are to expect a
different subject from the following main clause.
```
```
(10) [ a-di j ə b kur-d ə -k ][ ata ya:d ]
DIST.DEM-PL design make-3SG.M-COMPL.PS then go.3SG.M.PST
```

**554 Alexandra Y. Aikhenvald and Carol Genetti**

```
The verb always occurs at the very end of a chained clause. In a main clause, the order is
more flexible: the verb-final principle is a tendency rather than a steadfast rule. To explore
switch reference further, do the exercise in Stop and Reflect LP10.2.
```
### STOP AND REFLECT LP10.2: SWITCH REFERENCE IN A MANAMBU NARRATIVE

Manambu narrative text with sound files
Consider the following sentence, which is Sentence (10) of the Manambu narrative text that is available on
the website. For convenience, the glosses for switch-reference morphology are highlighted in bold. There
are three characters referenced by this sentence: the mother (“she”), the small masculine child, and the
older brother. Determine which character is the subject referent of each clause and observe how the switch-
reference system works. Based on the logic of this system, which character was the subject (who took the
basket) in line (b)? The speaker did not use a clause-chaining form in line (e). If she had, would it have been a

```
10.3 **Grammatical Relations**

```
Understanding grammatical relations in Manambu is pivotal for getting a grasp of its struc-
ture. Grammatical relations are marked in two ways: by case-marking on nouns, and by
agreement on verbs. Although these are common ways of indicating grammatical relations
cross-linguistically, the way these are realized in Manambu is typologically unusual.
```
10.3.1 Verb Agreement

```
Verbs in Manambu can be inflected by two sets of suffixes that mark the person, gender, and
number of arguments. Verbs can be fully or partially inflected. Fully inflected verbs agree
with (or “cross-reference”) two arguments: the subject and any other argument (except the
copula complement or quoted speech) that is more topical than the subject, i.e., the topic.
(See Textbox LP10.7 for a discussion of topicality.) Partially inflected verbs agree with only
the subject; an example of this is the non-final verb in (10). Some verbs are uninflected and
```

**555 Language Profile 10 Manambu**

```
don’t take person agreement at all; we saw this with the desiderative verb in (8) and the
non-final same-subject verb in (9).
If there is no constituent more topical than the subject and the verb is a fully inflected
verb, the subject (A or S) is cross-referenced as the topic. This is done with one of the set of
‘topic’ agreement suffixes (glossed TOP). The full paradigm of suffixes that cross-reference
the most topical argument is given in Table LP10.4.
```
### TEXTBOX LP10.7 TOPICALITY

```
Many languages are like Manambu in having
grammatical means – such as morphemes or separate
constructions – that indicate whether or not the people
or entities referred to by arguments are important to
```
```
the surrounding discourse. If they are, they are likely to
come up repeatedly. Such referents are considered to
be topical in the discourse.
```
```
TABLE LP10.4 Agreement paradigm for topical arguments
```
```

```
```

2.M -d ə -m ə n
```
```
3.F -ø -l
-b ə r -di
3.M -d
```
```
Consider Example (11). The ambitransitive verb ‘know’ is used intransitively, i.e., without
any object. The subject, ‘he,’ is cross-referenced on the verb as the most topical argument.
```
```
(11) bu lakuna-d
already know-3SG.M.TOP.NPST
‘He knows (already); he is knowledgeable’
This same verb can be used transitively, with an object. In (12) the object is not topical,
that is, it is not something that is likely to be further discussed in the discourse. Since the
subject is the most topical argument in the clause, again it is the only participant cross-ref-
erenced on the verb.
```
```
(12) [ ka ma:j ]O lakuna-d
PROX.DEM.SG.F story know-3SG.M.TOP.NPST
‘He knows/understands this story’
```

**556 Alexandra Y. Aikhenvald and Carol Genetti**

```
A non-subject argument can also be cross-referenced by these suffixes if it is more topical
than the subject. This is true regardless of the verb’s transitivity. In Example (13) the object is
topical (the conversation revolves around the road) and is thus indexed by a suffix from the
paradigm in Table LP10.4, the same set used for the subject in (11) and (12). The subject is also
cross-referenced on the verb, but now with a different suffix from an independent set, given
in Table LP10.5. Thus the verb in (13) agrees with two arguments: the topic and the subject.
```
**(13)** [ _l_ ə]A _a-d_ ə [ _yab_ ə _-m_ ]O _laku-la-d_
3 SG.F DIST.DEM-SG.Mroad(M)-ACC/LOC know-3SG.F.SBJ.NPST-3SG.M.TOP.NPST
‘She knows the road (fully)’

```

```
```
3.F -la- -l ə -
-dana- -da
3.M -da- -d ə -
```
```
Arguments other than the subject or object can also be topics and cross-referenced on the
verb. In (14) it is the addressee that is marked, since it is the topic.
```
**(14)** _d_ ə _k_ ə _-k ata wa-tu_ ə _-d_
3 SG.M-DAT thus say-1SG.SBJ.PST-3SG.M.TOP.PST
‘I said to him thus’

```
In (15) the topical argument refers to a time (note that ‘time’ is usually feminine, being con-
ceived of as round and cyclic; hence the feminine form of the demonstrative ‘that’ is used).
```
**(15)** [ _as_ ə _k_ ə _r_ ]TEMPORAL _ya-d_ ə _-l_
DIST.DEM.SG.Ftime come-3SG.M.SBJ.PST-3SG.F.TOP.PST
‘He came at that time’

```
The choice between cross-referencing one or two arguments on a Manambu verb is largely
independent of the verb’s transitivity: both transitive and intransitive verbs can cross-refer-
ence one or two arguments.
The Manambu system of verb agreement is typologically unusual in two ways. First, the
number of cross-referenced arguments (one of which has to be the subject) depends on the
```

**557 Language Profile 10 Manambu**

```
discourse properties of the non-subject constituent, rather than on the transitivity, or other
lexical properties, of the verb.
Secondly, the subject can be cross-referenced by one of two sets of suffixes, as opposed to
just one. But note that the subject is the only argument that must be marked on the verb in
one way or the other. Thus, the verbal agreement system constitutes evidence for the gram-
matical relation of subject, despite the fact that two sets of suffixes are involved. The system
also provides evidence for the grammatical relation of topic in Manambu, as the topic is the
argument cross-referenced by the paradigm in Table LP10.4.
```
```
10.3.2 Case-Marking on Nouns and Grammatical Relations
In addition to verb agreement, grammatical relations are also indicated by case-marking,
with subjects being marked one way, and non-subjects being marked differently. Nouns
distinguish nine case forms. Case-markers are distributed as follows:
```
```
i. Subjects do not take any case-markers.
ii. Objects can either not be case-marked or take the case-marker - Vm. This pattern will be dis-
cussed further below.
iii. Oblique arguments take case-markers based upon their semantics. The oblique cases are as
follows.
a. locative case (‘at’, ‘to’) - Vm
b. dative-aversive (‘to’, ‘for fear of’) - Vk
c. comitative (‘with’ as in ‘do something with someone’) - wa
d. terminative (‘up to a point’) - Vb
e. transportative (‘via transport’) - say, -sap
f. allative-instrumental (‘to’ or ‘with (an instrument)’) -Vr
g. substitutive ‘instead of’ -yœy
```
```
The object of a transitive verb takes no case-marker if it is either indefinite, or non- referential
and non-topical, or not completely involved in the activity. An example is in (12) above:
‘this story’ is not topical and thus is not case-marked. (Similar examples are ‘grass skirt’ in
(3), ‘clothing’ in (6), and ‘ropes’ in (7)). See Textbox LP10.8 for a comparison of this type of
case-marking pattern to that found in Spanish.
```
### TEXTBOX LP10.8 DIFFERENTIAL OBJECT MARKING IN SPANISH

```
This type of pattern, where objects take a case-
marker only if they have certain semantic or discourse
properties, is common cross-linguistically. The technical
name for this in linguistics is differential object
marking. An example of another language with
differential object marking is Spanish. In the sentence
Esta mañana he visto a la hermana de María ‘This
morning I saw Maria’s sister,’ the object is obligatorily
```
```
marked with the accusative preposition a. Contrast this
with Esta mañana he visto la nueva iglesia ‘this morning
I saw the new church,’ where the object is unmarked,
due to the semantic and discourse properties of the
noun phrase (i.e., it is inanimate and non-topical). The
factors that determine the presence or absence of a
with objects in Spanish are famously subtle, and there is
a large literature on this subject.
```

**558 Alexandra Y. Aikhenvald and Carol Genetti**

```
In contrast, the noun ‘male children’ in (16) is the topic of a stretch of discourse, and so it
acquires case-marking, in addition to being cross-referenced on the verb. That is, agreement
on verbs and case-marking on nouns follow different principles.
```
**(16)** _a kuprap_ ə _wapi dua-ñan-ugw-a:m_
DIST.DEM.SG.F bad bird man-child-PL-ACC
_k_ ə _-la-di_
eat-3SG.F.SBJ.PST-3PL.TOP.PST
‘That bad bird ate up the male children (we are talking about)’

```
tVerb agreement: subjects are always cross-referenced; non-subjects are cross-referenced only
if they are topical.
tCase-marking: subjects are never case-marked; objects are case-marked only if definite,
referential, and/or topical. Non-core arguments are case-marked in accordance with their
semantic role.

### CHAPTER SUMMARY

```
We have seen that the grammatical structures of Manambu are typologically interesting
and unique. These include a nominal gender system, ambitransitive verbs, two subclasses
of adjectives, an extensive set of demonstratives that distinguish direction in addition
to distance, clause-chaining with switch reference, differential object marking, and a
complex system of argument cross-referencing that is sensitive to discourse concerns.
However, even though the grammar may seem exotic, the pieces are familiar and the
language follows the same core principles on which other grammatical systems are
based. This universality across languages attests to the common cognitive make-up of
our species, and the common needs of speakers in daily communication within societal
structures. We’ve also seen hints at the relationship between the Manambu language and
culture, as the language simultaneously reflects and transmits the Manambu worldview.

### EXERCISES

**1.** The discussion of the Manambu personal pronouns provided an analysis of the distribution of the
    grammatical categories of person, gender, and number, stating where they are marked and where they are
    neutralized. Construct a similar paradigm for English personal pronouns. Analyze the categories and write
    a similar set of statements that accurately characterize the distribution of grammatical categories. Then
    provide a set of statements on how the English and Manambu paradigms are similar and how they are
    different.
**2.** Review the discussion on the semantic basis of gender assignment and the effect of gender on lexical
    meanings. Given this discussion, consider each pair of expressions below. Of the two meanings given,
    which is likely to be signaled by the masculine form of the expression, and which is likely to be signaled by
    the feminine form?
    **a.** _numa s_ ə _kal_
       ‘big distance’
       ‘enormous distance’
    **b.** _trausis_ (loanword from English)
       ‘trousers’
       ‘trousers for a baby’
    **c.** _vaey_
       ‘spear’
       ‘gun’
    **d.** _wi_
       ‘house’
       ‘palace’
    **e.** _ta:b_
       ‘finger’
       ‘hand/arm’
    **f.** _ab_
       ‘head’
       ‘headache’
    **g.** _g_ ə _l_
       ‘raincloud’
       ‘clouds covering whole sky’
    **h.** _numa_
       ‘man’
       ‘fat round man’
    **i.** _ga:n_
       ‘somewhat dark night’
       ‘completely dark night’


**561 Language Profile 10 Manambu**

**3.** The following pairs of clauses each exemplify ambitransitive verbs in Manambu. For each pair, determine
    whether the verb is of the S.of.I=O.of.T type (where the subject of the intransitive clause corresponds to
    the object of the transitive) or the S.of.I=S.of.T type (where the subject of the intransitive corresponds to
    the subject of the transitive). See Section LP10.2.4 of this profile to review this distinction.
    **a.** _kaykwa-_ ‘spill’ (transitive); ‘capsize’ (intransitive)
    **b.** _rali-_ ‘untie’ (transitive); ‘come untied’ (intransitive)
    **c.** _laku-_ ‘know’ (transitive); ‘be knowing’ (intransitive)
    **d.** _kaja-_ ‘move (something) apart’ (transitive); ‘disperse; move apart’ (intransitive)
    **e.** _s_ ə _luku-_ ‘forget something’ (transitive); ‘be forgotten’ (intransitive)
    **f.** _j_ ə _-_ ‘chew something’ (transitive); ‘chew’ (intransitive)
**4.** Each of the Manambu sentences below consists of multiple clauses in a clause chain. For the purposes
    of this exercise, verbs with clause-chaining morphology are in boldface, although the suffixes have not
    been separated and glossed. Based on the meanings of each example, state which of the following clause-
    chaining forms would be most appropriate for each boldfaced verb:
    Sequential action, same subject
    Sequential action, different subject
    Simultaneous action, same subject
    Simultaneous action, different subject
    **a.** [ _nak aki-taba:r_ **vœki:n** ][ _nak mapa-taba:r vœrad_ ]

       ‘Shall I bring it downstairs and put it down?’

       POSS.SG.M child water consume die-3SG.M then cry.3SG.M
       ‘After his son had drowned, then (the father) cried.’
    **e. [kusuta:y]** [ _vœra-kna-d_ ə _m_ ə _n_ ]

       ‘You will come to us wearing (the shirt).’
       (Context: mother telling a boy to try on a new shirt)
**5.** In Example (4d) above, the expression translated as ‘drown’ in English is actually a clause chain _gu k_ ə _-ku kiya-_
    _d_ ə _k_ , literally ‘consumed water and died.’ The verb _k_ ə _-ku_ has the suffix for sequential, same-subject clause
    chains. This implies a conceptualization of drowning as involving events in sequence (drink water, then die).
    Does this match your conceptualization of drowning? Why or why not? You may want to consider how
    drowning is expressed in English or other languages that you speak in addressing this. (For a larger project,
    look up expressions for drowning in other languages and compare.)
**6.** In each of the examples below, the final inflection of the verb has been replaced by a series of Xs. Using the
    paradigms in Tables LP10.4 and LP10.5, provide the appropriate cross-referencing suffix or suffixes for each
    of the following Manambu sentences. In each case, the topical argument is given in bold.

**LANGUAGE PROFILE 11**

African–American English

11.1 **Introduction**

```
The lyrics of Beyoncé. The voice of actor James Earl Jones. The rhetoric of Martin Luther
King, Jr. The poetry of Toni Morrison. The speeches of Sojourner Truth. In each of these spo-
ken and written texts, we can see and hear particular linguistic features that characterize the
variety of English used by people of the African Diaspora. This linguistic variety , or
dialect , which most linguists today call African–American English , is widely regarded
as the most researched of all varieties of English.
African–American English has been called by many names, including but not limited
to: African–American Language, African–American Vernacular English, Black English, and
Ebonics. African–American English patterns have been called “Urban English” (especially in
the US North and Northeast) and “Rural English” (especially in the US South). Some terms
for the variety are more academic, while others are used in everyday settings. Some are cur-
rent, and some have fallen out of favor. The sheer variety of the terms illustrates the impos-
sibility of attempting to put one name and one face on American people of African heritage.
```
### STOP AND REFLECT LP11.1 WHAT’S IN A NAME?

```
Consider the many terms that have been used to refer to the linguistic patterns of Americans of African
descent. Which terms have you heard? How do they reflect the historical and cultural context in which they
were used? Do you think the term “African–American English” will still be used in the future, and if not, why?
Consider such factors as marriage and childrearing across racial/ethnic groups, immigration, and the politics
of identity. What other terms do you think might develop instead, and why? If you are from a country other
than the United States, what names have been given to historically stigmatized groups in that country? How
do such questions apply?
```
11.1.1 Who Speaks African–American English?

```
According to the US Census, there are over 45 million people who identify as being of African–
American descent in the United States, but the number of speakers of African–American
English is not as easy to calculate (see Textbox LP11.1). In some regions of the United States,
the linguistic patterns of African–American speakers overlap with the language patterns of
other ethnic/cultural groups who live in the same area. Because African–American English
```

**564 Anne H. Charity Hudley and Christine Mallinson**

```
is predominantly, but not exclusively, spoken by African–
Americans, the total number of people who use features of
African–American English may be greater than the num-
ber of people who identify as African–American. In addi-
tion, not all African–Americans use features or identify as
speakers of this variety. In general, in this language profile
we use the term “African–American English” to refer to varieties
of English used in places where African–Americans live or historically have lived, while
acknowledging the variability and ambiguity that accompany any attempt to define how
language is used along cultural or ethnic lines.

### TEXTBOX LP11.1 THE BLACK POPULATION IN THE UNITED STATES

```
According to the US Census Bureau, as of July 1, 2015,
of the total US population of 321.4 million, 42.6 million
people (13%) identified as Black or African–American.
In addition, 3.6 million people (1%) reported as
Black in combination with one or more other races.
Together, these groups comprise the Black alone-or-in-
combination population, totaling 46.2 million people.
The Black alone-or-in-combination population grew
```
```
by 15% from 2000 to 2010 and by 7% from 2010 to
2015; in addition, the Black-alone population grew
by 12% from 2000 to 2010 and by 6% from 2010 to
```
2015. These growth rates are higher than the growth
rates for the total US population during those same
time periods. In 2015, 55% of the Black population
lived in the US South, and over 100 Southern US
counties had a Black population of 50% or higher.

In 1619, enslaved Africans first arrived in the United States, landing near Hampton,
Virginia, with greater numbers subsequently arriving in waves as part of the global slave
trade. While slavery existed into the Northeast, even into New England, it was con-
centrated in the US South, where the language patterns of the Africans who worked as
forced laborers came into contact with those of local Whites. During this time period,
African–American English was, for the most part, localized to the South. Once slavery
had been abolished and Jim Crow laws dismantled, however, African–Americans began
to leave the region.
```

**565 Language Profile 11 African–American English**

```
Throughout the mid-1900s, the population shift known
as the Great Migration – in which African–Americans
moved out of the South, generally to urban areas such as
Philadelphia and Detroit – had a linguistic effect. Owing
to patterns of residential segregation, African–Americans
tended to move to neighborhoods where other African–
Americans lived (Massey and Denton 1993). Thus, the
largely Southern-inflected patterns of African–American
English began to merge with Northern speech patterns
and evolved into a contemporary variety of African–
American English. Over time, this variety spread from the
cities of the Northeast to the West. It also spread back into
the South, as some African–Americans who had moved
away kept in contact with their Southern family members
or eventually returned to live there again.
Today, African–American English is widely spoken across
the United States, from large cities to rural locales. Owing to
a continuing legacy of residential segregation as well as cul-
tural affiliation, speakers of African–American English still

tend to live near and associate with others who speak this variety (Labov 2008). At the same time,
because African–American English has always been in contact with other varieties of English, it
shares many linguistic features with these varieties, even as it has its own distinguishing charac-
teristics. In recent decades, as greater numbers of immigrants of Caribbean and African heritage
have settled in the United States, definitions of African–American English are expanding to
account for the influence of these speakers as they come into contact with African–Americans,
acquire some of their language patterns, and contribute their own to the mix.
```
11.2 **African–Americans and the African and Creole Linguistic**

**Diaspora**

```
Within sociocultural linguistics, there are two main theories on the development of
African–American English in the United States (Wolfram and Thomas 2002). The first
theory, called the Anglicist hypothesis , states that African–
American English is primarily a product of the acquisition of
English by Africans and African–Americans. People who adhere
to the Anglicist hypothesis maintain that African–American
English is a variety of English, rather than one with origins in a
distinct creole language.
The second theory, called the Creolist hypothesis , states that
creole languages were formed when enslaved Africans speaking
different languages came into contact. In areas where speakers
were more isolated, creole languages such as Gullah, Jamaican
English, and Patois were established and still survive. (For more on
creoles and varieties of English influenced by African Languages,
see Textbox LP11.2.) In areas where speakers’ isolation was not
as severe, the Creolist hypothesis states, English more heavily
influenced the creole languages that formed, which resulted in
the development of varieties such as African–American English.

```

**567 Language Profile 11 African–American English**

```
For example, Gullah is a creole spoken by about 250,000
Gullah people of African descent who live in or have
ties to the coasts and Sea Islands of South Carolina and
Georgia. Because of the isolated nature of the places
where Gullah people live, many aspects of African
language and culture have been preserved in the
language. Gullah is a source of pride for many African–
Americans as it demonstrates the linguistic and cultural
connections that exist between African–American English
and Niger-Congo language systems (Turner 1949). These
connections are evident. For example, the documentary
“The Language You Cry In: The Story of a Mende Song”
```
```
shows the migration of a funeral song from Sierra Leone
to speakers of the Gullah language.
Opinions will vary as to whether these are varieties
or languages, which indicates the controversial
social and political nature of language contact and
language formation. Linguists are working on fuller
descriptions of each creole variety, as much of the
work so far has focused on the syntactic structures of
the languages and varieties. What we do know is that
they are not forms of “Broken English” but systematic
language patterns with vibrant histories and cultures.

Theories on the origin of African–American English are difficult to verify, however. The
brutal nature of slavery and the intentional separation of those who spoke similar African
languages, combined with the lack of extensive documentation of spoken and written lan-
guage patterns from earlier time periods, complicate the task of fully explicating the histor-
ical and linguistic record.
Although the question of the true origin of African–American English may never be
resolved, other issues hold more immediate and practical importance. For instance, how
is African–American English perceived and understood outside of the African–American
English-speaking community? What characteristics of this vari-
ety are most salient for its speakers? How do professionals and
practitioners – particularly those in positions of power such
as judges, police officers, and educators – understand African–
American English? What are the social implications of percep-
tions about African–American English for those who speak it? In
situations of linguistic bias and discrimination, how can mecha-
nisms to achieve equity be put into place?
```
11.3 **African–American English: A Linguistic Overview**

```
Today, most linguists view African–American English as a variety of English. Other scholars
prefer to call it African–American Language, following the notion that the definition of
dialect versus language is blurry, more deeply rooted in the histories of social and cul-
tural power than in linguistic reality. Regardless of the terminology used, linguists agree on
three important findings about African–American English. First, it is spoken by millions of
people across the United States and other countries. Second, it
has roots in African languages. Third, African–American English
as a linguistic variety is not substandard English, but rather is a
systematic, rule-governed, and patterned system, just as all other
languages and varieties are.
```

versus language, see Section 1.2.1.

**568 Anne H. Charity Hudley and Christine Mallinson**

```
African–American English shares many linguistic features with Standard English. Most
linguistic work has centered not on these overlaps, however, but on the divergences. At
the same time, there are no simple, binary divisions between African–American English
and Standard English. It is important to remember that African–American English, like any
language system, is complex and inherently variable, with both inter-speaker varia-
tion and intra-speaker variation. The use of African–American English may vary by a
range of factors, including age, gender, region, degree of cultural affiliation or separation,
and more (Rickford 1999). An individual who speaks both African–American English and
Standard English may be considered bidialectal ; having a wide linguistic repertoire
can be a valuable sociocultural resource.
Social class and gender are two key social axes of variability in African–American English.
Linguists have found that middle-class African–Americans tend to use elements of African–
American English to a lesser degree than African–Americans from working-class back-
grounds. African–American males (particularly younger working-class males) tend to use
features of African–American English more frequently than African–American females, espe-
cially stigmatized features (Charity 2005). However, sometimes class- and gender-related lin-
guistic differences recede or disappear as speakers age (Craig and Washington 2002, 2004 ).
For this reason it is important not to assume a fixed linguistic trajectory for any individual.
Much research still needs to be conducted on variation within African–American
English. For instance, only limited research has examined what features are used by mid-
dle-class African–Americans. Along similar lines, few studies have focused on African–
Americans who do not use features of African–American English. A still relatively small
body of literature has examined the speech of non -African–Americans who use features of
African–American English. More work is also needed to understand language variation in
African–Americans with respect to gender identities and sexual orientation. Finally, lin-
guists are beginning to pay greater attention to how language use varies by factors related
to identity – for instance, by the growing population of people who identify or are iden-
tified as multiracial/multiethnic.
```
11.3.1 Phonetics and Phonology

```
The question of whether a person “sounds African–American” or has an “African–American
accent ” relates to the phonetics and phonology of African–American English. Some phono-
logical features of African–American English are shared by other varieties of American English,
especially Southern US English , while others are more unique to African–American English.
Regarding consonants in African–American English, linguists have robustly studied var-
iation in consonant clusters. For almost any speaker of English, complex consonant
clusters are frequently reduced: words such as mists and guests often are pronounced as
[mɪs] and [ܳɛs] rather than [mɪsts] and [ܳɛsts]. Similar reduction occurs in African–American
English, only more frequently and in a wider range of linguistic contexts. For example,
mind is often pronounced as [maܼn] rather than [maɪnd], talked as [tɔk] rather than [tɔkt].
From decades of research, linguists have found that this sociolinguistic variable , gen-
erally known as consonant cluster reduction or as [t, d] deletion, is regular, patterned, and
governed by subtle and complex linguistic rules.
```

**569 Language Profile 11 African–American English**

```
Unique consonant blends are also found in African–American English. For instance, [stɹ]
clusters may sometimes be pronounced as [skɹ], as in [skɹiޝt] for [stɹiޝt] street and [skɹeܼt] for
[stɹeɪt] straight. This consonant feature is also found in the Gullah language. Other conso-
nantal features are discussed in Textbox LP11.3.
```
### TEXTBOX LP11.3 THREE CONSONANTAL FEATURES OF AFRICAN–AMERICAN ENGLISH

```
Listeners often notice several differences in consonant
pronunciations, notably in the word ask and in words
with /r/ and /ș/. Some, though not all, speakers of
African–American English pronounce the word ask
as [æks] rather than [æsk]. This pronunciation is so
commonly noticed that it has become a stereotyped
feature of African–American English and is often
stigmatized and even mocked. Ironically, the
pronunciation of ask as [æks] has existed since the
eighth century, stemming from variation in the Old
English verb acsian.
Variation in words with / r / and /ș/ are also
characteristic of African–American English. In this
variety, [݋] may be absent or nearly absent. For instance,
the word mother may be pronounced as [mʌðə] rather
than [mʌðɹ̩], car as [kɑ] rather than [kɑɹ], and bird
```
```
as [bɜɪd] rather than [bɝd] or [bɚd]. Some of these
correspondences are similar to those found between
British and American English, as described in Chapter 2.
Words with /ș/ and /ð/ also may vary in
pronunciation. Depending on whether the sound in
question is [ș] or [ð], it may be pronounced as [d],
[v], [t], or [f] or as a glottal stop, [ʔ]. Words such as
this [ðɪs] and them [ðɛm] may be pronounced as [dɪs]
and [dɛm]; neither [ˈni:ðɚ] and breathe [bɹi:ð] may be
pronounced as [ˈni:və] and [bɹi:v]; think [θɪŋk] and
thanks [θæŋks] may be pronounced as [tɪŋk] and
[tæŋks], and with [wɪð] or [wɪθ] may be pronounced as
[wɪf], [wɪt], or [wݦܼ]. Similar sound patterns are found
in the Gullah language and in the languages of West
Africa.
```
```
Regarding vowels, there tends to be some overlap between the pronunciations of African–
American and Southern White speakers, which reveals the Southern roots of African–American
English. For instance, consider the sociolinguistic variable that
linguists refer to as the pin - pen merger, which refers to the
near-identical pronunciation of /ɪ/ and /ɛ/ before nasal con-
sonants for many speakers of Southern English and African–
American English. For these speakers, words such as pin and
pen or windy and Wendy are pronounced in indistinguishable
ways. Speakers of African–American English who live outside
the US South generally also have Southern-influenced vowel
pronunciations and tend not to participate in other vowel pat-
terns that characterize the speech of local Whites, but ongoing
research is necessary to fully understand these dynamics.
African–American English also has vowel sounds that are
more unique to this variety. For example, the sequence [e݋] at
the end of a syllable in Standard English may be pronounced
as [əɹ], e.g., there [ðəɹ] and carry [ޖkəɹi]. Hip-hop songs con-
taining this sociolinguistic variant have helped it gain
popularity and spread (Blake et al. 2009).

The sounds of African–American English also involve differ-
ences in pitch, tone, rhythm, and volume. Many listeners report
that the prosody of a person’s voice may mark that speaker as
African–American even if their variety otherwise sounds stand-
ard (Baugh 2000). Some linguistic research finds that speakers
of African–American English are more likely to talk in a lower
pitch, have a wider pitch range, and use more falsetto (see, e.g., Cole et al. 2005). Research
has also found that younger African–American males may show less variation in intona-
tion – for instance, questions are often asked with a more flat, rather than rising, intona-
tion. Listeners accustomed to a different intonational pattern, however, can sometimes
misinterpret flat intonation patterns as indications of disinterest, boredom, disrespect, or
apathy. Those who may incorrectly assess the speaker as unenergetic or uninterested may
then judge the students differently in school. If this occurs in classroom situations, it can
lead to African–American English-speaking students being improperly evaluated – aca-
demically, socially, and emotionally (Charity 2005). In general, challenges can arise when
educators do not recognize or understand the phonological patterns of African–American
English; such challenges may include the disproportionate referral of African–American
students for speech pathology services (Dandy 1991).
```
11.3.2 Morphology and Syntax

```
Linguists have also robustly studied the morphology and syntax of African–American
English, which constitute its grammar. For most listeners, the morphological and syntactic
features of African–American English are more noticeable and distinct than its phonologi-
cal features. Though there are many more morphological and syntactic features specific to
African–American English than can be described here, this section focuses on three impor-
tant verb features, each of which demonstrates a distinctive use of tense and aspect in
African–American English.
First, we discuss the use of habitual be , also sometimes called invariant be , a frequently
noticed (and frequently parodied) grammatical feature of African–American English.
Speakers of Standard English have no verb-internal means of distinguishing habituality for
the verb to be. In a sentence that aims to express habituality, such as My grandparents usually
watch TV on Saturday nights , it is generally marked by using the present tense of is or are plus
an adverb, such as usually, typically, often , or regularly. In comparison, speakers of African–
American English use invariant be to convey habituality. Thus, the same example sentence
in African–American English would read, My grandparents be watching TV on Saturday nights.
A second grammatical feature of African–American English
that is often noticed (and often marked as an error in students’
writing at school) is variation in the use of auxiliary verbs, nota-
bly forms of the verb to be. African–American English has three
choices for how to use these forms: the verb forms may be fully
produced, they may be contracted, or they may be absent. Standard English has only two: full
or contracted. For example, a Standard English speaker might say, She is smart (full) or She’s
smart (contracted). In African–American English, the full and contracted forms are possible,
```

prosody and intonation, refer to
Chapter 10.
```
### SIDEBAR LP11.10

```
To refresh your memory about
auxiliary verbs , see Section 5.3.
```

**571 Language Profile 11 African–American English**

```
as well as the third option – absent: She smart. One important
distinction is that, in African–American English, this type of
zero auxiliary or zero copula can never occur when the
subject is I or when the sentence is in the past tense. Thus, in
African–American English, it is grammatical to say You running,
She running , and They running , but not * I running. It is grammat-
ical to say You running today, She running today , and They running
today but not * She running yesterday. Similar use of the auxiliary
forms of to be can be found in the Gullah languages and in
creole languages spoken in Barbados, Guyana, Jamaica, and Trinidad.
A third verb feature unique to African–American English is stressed bin (pronounced
[bܼn] and sometimes called stressed been ). In this usage, the word bin is emphasized in pro-
nunciation and is paired with a main verb in the simple past tense. It indicates that an event
has happened in the remote past – that is, a long time prior to the present. For example,
a child who speaks African–American English might say to her parent, I bin finished my
lunch , meaning that the child already finished her lunch a while ago, and perhaps implying
that the parent should have already known this information. In comparison, in Standard
English, remote past is generally indicated through the use of phrases such as a long time ago.
Linguistic evidence reveals that the unique verb forms discussed in this section (as well as
other features of African–American English) are regular, patterned, and predictable in how
they portray tense, mood, aspect, and meaning. These forms are not haphazard mistakes
or linguistic deficiencies, even though they may not always be understood or appreciated
by non-African–American English speakers. These particular verb forms and other linguistic
features reveal the innovation inherent in this variety; they also often indicate connections
between African–American English, African languages, and African-based creole languages.
```
```
11.3.3 Lexicon, Discourse, and Representation
Many words have come into other varieties of English through the speech of African–Americans.
Words such as banana, banjo, mumbo jumbo , and zombie have roots in languages brought by
enslaved Africans, who also often used exclusive vocabulary and coded words and expressions
as a powerful means of resistance. Many words that are no longer thought of as slang, such
as cool , originated in African–American English. The media has
helped African–American English vocabulary spread into the gen-
eral English lexicon, often by emphasizing words used by young
African–American males. Some of these lexical items, such as the
n -word, have a complicated history and an ever-evolving usage.
Discourse-level features of African–American English have
been well documented. The use of direct commands tends to be more frequent in African–
American English. Also, speakers may frequently talk simultaneously, with the overlapping
speech often viewed as normal and comfortable and not considered interruption. Storytelling
is also a valued skill in African–American English. In African–American English, stories can
cover several topics that may be associated, both explicitly and implicitly, in ways that reveal
links to West African storytelling traditions (Champion 2003). In this regard, stories told in

African–American English often have a distinct cultural style that
differs from the single topic, linear style that is considered norma-
tive in Standard English.
On television, in books, in films, and in music, the public often
receives mixed messages about African–American English. Today,
through the increasing popularity of hip-hop music and culture,
which draws heavily upon African–American culture, aspects of
African–American English are widely known – not only across the
United States, but around the world. On the one hand, African–
American English is often admired as being cool and innovative. On
the other hand, a strongly negative language ideology often sur-
rounds African–American English and its speakers, as many listeners
characterize this variety and those who speak it as being unprofes-
sional, sloppy, or incorrect. Questions of representation, interpreta-
tion, and perception raise the related question of who is an authentic
speaker of African–American English. Tensions surrounding who has the power to name, label, and
portray can arise whenever certain individuals control voice, tone, and point of view. How language
and culture are represented, received, and analyzed is always open to debate (see Textbox LP11.4).

### TEXTBOX LP11.4 EYE DIALECT

```
The question of how to represent discourse and
dialogue in fiction surfaces in many great works of
literature, particularly because there is no standardized
way to represent spoken language in writing. One
common means is to use the technique of eye dialect ,
in which phonological variation is represented with
alternative spellings, as in enuff for enough or ritin’ for
writing. American fiction is well known for the use of
eye dialect, as seen, for instance, in the plays of Eugene
O’Neill and Tennessee Williams, the short stories of
Flannery O’Connor, and novels such as Adventures of
Huckleberry Finn, The Color Purple, The Grapes of Wrath ,
and Their Eyes Were Watching God. There is also a strong
tradition of using eye dialect in British literature; a few
examples include the novels of Dickens, such as Bleak
House and David Copperfield , George Bernard Shaw’s
Pygmalion , and the “Harry Potter” series.
One benefit of the use of eye dialect is that it
immediately announces to the reader the fact that
a particular character speaks differently from others.
Authors may also use eye dialect to introduce readers
to an unfamiliar language variety; for example, when
reading Adventures of Huckleberry Finn , many students
report that they would never have known how Huck and
Jim were supposed to sound if Mark Twain had not used
```
```
eye dialect. When it comes to representing the discourse
and dialogue of African–Americans, however, specific
cultural and linguistic issues can arise. Consider To Kill a
Mockingbird, Uncle Tom’s Cabin , and the contemporary
novel The Help , written by White authors. The fact that
the language of African–American characters is portrayed
using eye dialect, while the speech of White characters is
represented with Standard English, has been the subject
of much critical analysis. Sometimes, when authors
represent the speech of people from a different culture,
especially when drawing on limited experience with this
group, the use of eye dialect can reflect assumptions
and prejudices, rather than representing actual linguistic
features. In such circumstances, the use of eye dialect
can lead to linguistic stereotyping and caricature of
African–Americans. On the other hand, authors such
as Zora Neale Hurston have used eye dialect to great
acclaim. Many of Hurston’s characters talk in ways that
mirror the speech of people Hurston grew up with
in Alabama and Florida. Other characters represent
the people Hurston studied as an ethnographer and
folklorist. In her literary works, Hurston made extensive
use of eye dialect, and many contemporary scholars
have deemed her representation of language to be
authentic and impressive.

11.4 Educational Implications for Speakers of African–American
English
When students come to school speaking African–American English, they are aware that
many of their relatives, friends, and neighbors speak similarly to themselves. They may
recognize that African–American English holds deep cultural value within the African–
American community. But, given the fact that over 80 percent of educators in the United
States are White and female, African–American students also likely realize that many of their
teachers and perhaps their peers do not speak African–American English. African–American
students may internalize the message that educators expect them to use Standard English
or a type of “School English” that may be at odds with their home language and culture.
Identity conflicts can arise when students feel compelled to shed what they perceive to be
their authentic speech patterns to succeed in a mainstream climate. Intentional variation
between Standard English and African–American English can be a valuable cultural and
educational resource. Yet, for some African–American students, attempting to sound like a
White speaker may cause a cultural problem, as “acting White” is frequently considered to
be a stigmatized behavior within the African–American community. Further, simply using
Standard English does not guarantee success for African–Americans: it is still the case that a
Standard English–speaking African–American might not get a particular job simply because
they are African–American. Thus, identity and race are two very significant social factors,
even in cases where linguistic difference may be minimal.
```
### STOP AND REFLECT LP11.3 PERCEPTIONS OF AFRICAN–AMERICAN ENGLISH BY

### AFRICAN–AMERICANS

```
There is more research about how non -African–Americans perceive African–American English than about
how African–Americans themselves perceive it. Why do you think this is? If you were to design a study to
interview members of the African–American community about how they perceive African–American English,
what questions might you ask in an interview? Would you ask about the role of African–American English as
a marker of personal identity? Of cultural affiliation? What about its role in education and the workplace? In
literature, film, and the media – including social media? Would you ask about issues of bias and prejudice and/
or about respect and pride? What other knowledge, tools, or resources might you need to carry out such a
study? What specific ethical considerations should you take into account?
```
```
As mentioned earlier, differences between African–American English and Standard English
can cause challenges for students. First, linguistic bias against African–American English can
affect students on a holistic level. Studies have found that, at all levels of education and
institutional contexts, listeners tend to favor speakers who sound like themselves and can
be biased against those who don’t (Lippi-Green 2012). As early as kindergarten, students
who come to school speaking in similar ways as their teachers are more likely to get ahead,
whereas those who speak differently, particularly African–American students, are more
likely to fall behind (Charity et al. 2005). Educators may form negative assumptions about
a student’s intelligence and ability based simply on how they talk, which can result in low-
ered expectations, stereotyping, and discrimination. Studies have found that educators tend
to rate students who speak African–American English as being overall less intelligent, less
```

**574 Anne H. Charity Hudley and Christine Mallinson**

```
confident, and less likely to succeed than students who speak in a more standardized way
(see Charity Hudley and Mallinson 2011). In addition, structural linguistic factors can have
an effect. For instance, phonological variation may make it difficult for African–American
children to determine what rhymes in Standard English, which may interfere with the
acquisition of reading and spelling conventions. Research finds that classwork containing
features of African–American English is routinely evaluated lower than otherwise equiva-
lent work written in Standard English, and the use of African–American English may nega-
tively affect students’ performance on standardized tests and writing assessments (Charity
2009 ). The use of African–American English has also been found to contribute to African–
American students’ disproportionate placement in remedial classes and special education.
At the same time, teacher-training programs that explicitly educate teachers about African–
American English have been found to ameliorate bias toward African–American students
and reduce the likelihood that students who speak African–American English are unfairly
assessed on linguistic grounds. Helping students understand the differences between the
norms and conventions of Standard English and those of African–American English, while
teaching them to value and respect both varieties, is crucial to their understanding of lan-
guage and their academic development. Educators and students alike thrive when they have
a deeper understanding of linguistic and cultural diversity, and linguists are increasingly
engaging in applied endeavors to bring that message into classrooms and schools.
```
### CHAPTER SUMMARY

```
In this profile, we have given a linguistic overview of African–American English. We have
reviewed some of its key phonological, phonetic, morphosyntactic, lexical, and discourse
features. In addition, we have discussed theories on its origin and development, examined
social and cultural contexts surrounding its use, and explored how language ideologies
can play a role in educational settings and other social implications that speakers of
African–American English may encounter. Some languages and language varieties
are deemed socially prestigious, while others, such as African–American English, are
frequently devalued by both speakers of the variety and by others. Our most important
linguistic and social point, which we reiterate in this summary, is that there is no inherent
linguistic deficiency in African–American English.
Even in the face of potential stigma and stereotypes, bias and discrimination, speakers
of African–American English (and any marginalized language or language variety) can still
assert their linguistic agency, both subtly and powerfully, by using their own authentic
language. Particularly within safe cultural spaces, the use of African–American English can
have powerful symbolic and communicative value, signaling in-group status, transmitting
particular meaning, and conveying solidarity. Each of us has our own compelling
narrative to tell. When we are empowered to engage with and build upon our own voice
and the voices of our homes and communities, our language becomes a resource. By
recognizing the cultural centrality and significance of African–American English, we
highlight this linguistic system as part of a broader conversation about how to honor and
cultivate diversity of expression within our multicultural society.

### EXERCISES

**1. The cultural significance of African–American English**
    https://newrepublic.com/article/95923/the-language-must-not-sweat
    In an interview for _New Republic_ magazine in 1981, author Toni Morrison said, “It is the thing that black
    people love so much – the saying of words, holding them on the tongue, experimenting with them,
    playing with them. It’s a love, a passion ... It’s terrible to think that a child with five different present tenses
    comes to school to be faced with those books that are less than his own language.” Read the entirety of
    the Morrison interview, then read an earlier article by author James Baldwin, written in 1979, “If Black
    English Isn’t a Language, Then Tell Me, What is?”.
       [http://www.nytimes.com/books/98/03/29/specials/baldwin-english.html](http://www.nytimes.com/books/98/03/29/specials/baldwin-english.html)
    **i.** Compare and contrast these pieces and identify two or three common themes that appear in each.
    **ii.** Think about how you would you write a blog post or create a short film about the cultural significance
       of African–American English for a lay audience. What main themes do you think would be important to
       include, and how would you communicate these ideas to diverse readers or viewers?
**2. Features of African–American English: Listen and transcribe**
    Watch the YouTube video clip, “African–American English in North Carolina,” produced by the Language
    and Life Project under the direction of linguist Walt Wolfram. Choose three of the phonological features of
    African–American English described in this language profile, listen for them in the video clip, and identify
    words with those features.


**576 Anne H. Charity Hudley and Christine Mallinson**

```
i. Transcribe the words you hear that contain the features. Be sure to provide the time stamp in the video
for each word you transcribe and state the name of the feature (e.g., consonant cluster reduction).
ii. Do any of the features seem similar to those you associate with English varieties of the US South? If so,
state those features. What explanation might you give for these similarities?
```
**3. Verb tenses in African–American English**

```
http://discovermagazine.com/1997/dec/suiteforebonyand1292
Linguist John R. Rickford wrote about Toni Morrison’s 1981 interview in his (1997) article “Suite for Ebony
and Phonics.” As he pointed out, “When Toni Morrison referred to the five present tenses of Ebonics, she
probably had usages like these – each one different from Standard English – in mind”:
i. He runnin. (He is running.)
ii. He be runnin. (He is usually running.)
iii. He be steady runnin. (He is usually running in an intensive, sustained manner.)
iv. He bin runnin. (He has been running.)
v. He BIN runnin. (He has been running for a long time and still is.)
Although all five of these sentences are in the present tense, they differ in their temporal
consistency or aspect.
i. Drawing on this language profile and on your own research, propose
linguistic terms for the aspects in the five examples provided by John
Rickford.
ii. Which examples have habitual be? Which have copula absence?
Which have stressed bin?
iii. Describe habitual be , copula absence, and stressed bin in linguistic
terms, stating both their grammatical properties and their meanings.
iv. Find examples of each of these structures in a novel, poem, or song
lyrics written by an African–American author or artist. Be sure to state
the title of the work, author, citation, and location of the example
within the work (e.g., p. 142, line 4, or second stanza).
```
**4. Analyzing African–American English in literature**
    Select two works of American literature that include portrayals of African–American English – one written
    by a White author (such as _Uncle Tom’s Cabin, The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, To Kill a Mockingbird_ )
    and one written by an African–American author (such as _Beloved, Their Eyes Were Watching God_ , or the
    poetry of Paul Laurence Dunbar or Alice Walker) – and compare and contrast the use of African–American
    English found in the text and/or in the dialogue. What linguistic features can you discover? Are there any
    differences in representation of African–American English according to author or the genre of the text? Is
    eye dialect used? How do you interpret your findings?
**5. A focus on education**
    Many of the challenges in the assessment of children who speak African–American English are a result of
    teachers’ lack of awareness of linguistic and cultural differences. Conventional testing situations have been
    shown to cause African–American (as well as other) children to become hesitant and taciturn because of
    the way that fill-in-the-blank and other test items often ask for answers that are not part of AAE. Download
    a copy of the DIBELS (Dynamic Indicators of Basic Early Literacy Skills) _Oral Reading Fluency Progress_
    _Monitoring First Grade Student Materials_ booklet (https://dibels.uoregon.edu/docs/materials/hifi_DORF_
    G1-6_PM_6th_Ed.pdf). Based on your knowledge of African–American English, assess which characteristics
    of the test passages might be biased against speakers of African–American English. Also note which items
    you are unsure about and indicate what your ambiguity stems from. Finally, consider the fact that DIBELS
    materials are also provided in Spanish. What may be some implications for speakers of language varieties
    such as African–American English?

**LANGUAGE PROFILE 12**

Indonesian

12.1 **Introduction**

12.1.1 Location and History

```
The population of the Republic of Indonesia is historically, culturally, ethnically, and lin-
guistically diverse. With more than 240 million people, present-day Indonesia boasts the
distinction of being the fourth most populated nation in the world, after China, India,
and the United States. Its heterogeneous population consists of hundreds of native ethnic
groups, who are estimated currently to speak at least 300 distinct languages. The creation
of the Republic of Indonesia involved a host of complex sociopolitical factors, one of the
most important of which has been the development, standardization, and promotion of
Indonesian as the official, national language of unification (see Textbox LP12.1 on the
language’s name).
The Republic of Indonesia is geographically located within the largest archipelago on
Earth, consisting of more than 17,000 equatorial islands, only about one-third of which
are inhabited. Indonesia is located between mainland Southeast Asia and Australia and
provides a crucial seafaring link between the Indian and Pacific oceans. Because of its stra-
tegic location, the archipelago has been characterized by extensive trade, colonization, and
contact, which has led to a rich and diverse cultural history. The first inhabitants of the
archipelago were Melanesians, followed by a migration of Austronesian people, the earliest
evidence of which dates back to around 2000 BCE. The next millennia saw the flourishing
of various Hindu kingdoms, Buddhist kingdoms, alliances between islands, and Sultanates.
Between the thirteenth and sixteenth centuries, the population gradually began to convert
to Islam, and, outside of Bali, which is still predominantly Hindu, Islam is now the majority
religion. In the early sixteenth century, the Portuguese colonized parts of the archipelago,
known popularly in those times as the “Spice Islands.” The Dutch colonized much of the
region beginning in the early seventeenth century and continued to occupy and govern the
islands until shortly after Indonesia declared independence on August 17, 1945, and began
promoting Indonesian as the official, national language.

### TEXTBOX LP12.1 WHAT TO CALL LANGUAGES

```
An autoglossonym is a linguistic term meaning “the
name of a language in that language” (lit. self-tongue-
name). For example, Deutsch is the autoglossonym
of the language that English speakers call German,
español is the autoglossonym for the language known
in English as Spanish, and so on. Indonesian speakers
call their own language bahasa Indonesia (lit. language
of Indonesia). Many foreigners mistakenly refer to
Indonesian simply as “Bahasa,” as in: “Oh, I learned
a little Bahasa when I went surfing in Bali.” However,
the word bahasa is a common noun that simply means
‘language,’ originating from the Sanskrit word bhas·a.
It is used productively in Indonesian to derive names
for all languages, e.g., bahasa Jepang (lit. language
of Japan) ‘Japanese,’ bahasa Perancis (lit. language of
France) ‘French,’ bahasa Jawa (lit. language of Java)
‘Javanese,’ bahasa Bali (lit. language of Bali) ‘Balinese,’
```
```
bahasa Inggris (lit. language of England) ‘English,’
and so forth. A foreigner who refers to Indonesian as
“Bahasa” is misanalyzing the autoglossonym.
When writing about the Indonesian language in an
English context, it is generally not appropriate to refer
to it as bahasa Indonesia. Just as this textbook refers to
other major world languages using English names such
as German or Spanish (rather than the autoglossonyms
Deutsch or español) , I will consistently use the English
name Indonesian throughout this profile. However,
especially for speakers of endangered and minority
languages, use of an autoglossonym can be seen
as a sign of respect and solidarity – and it is always
best for field linguists to be sensitive to the desire of
communities of speakers, and to refer to languages by
the names which its speakers prefer to have used in a
particular context.

12.1.2 Genetic Affiliation

```
Indonesian is a member of the Western Malayo-Polynesian branch of the Austronesian
language family. The Austronesian family is the largest language family in the world,
including approximately 1,300 languages – nearly 20 percent of
all languages on earth. Austronesian languages are widely spo-
ken along a 10,000 mile geographic range from Easter Island to
Madagascar. Indonesian is a variety of Malay, and is, to a large
extent, mutually intelligible with the varieties of Malay spoken in
Malaysia, Brunei Darussalam, and Singapore. The development
and standardization of formal Indonesian, used in education,
the media, and in public official settings, was achieved primar-
ily through government-sponsored language planning , an
issue to which we will return in Section LP12.4 of this profile.
Alongside Indonesian, numerous local and colloquial Malay varieties are also spoken, as are
numerous local languages.
```
12.2 **Speech Community and Viability**

```
Unlike many of the other languages profiled in this volume, Indonesian is quite robust,
with approximately 250 million speakers worldwide, including an estimated 17 million
people classified as native speakers. Recent estimates of the literacy rate in Indonesia
claim that upwards of 90 percent of the population can read Indonesian. The language
serves as the medium of instruction for most education and is the primary language in
broadcast and print media. Many Indonesians speak a local language as well: the three
most widely spoken are Javanese, Sundanese, and Madurese. As the urban populations of
Indonesia increase, and as people of different linguistic backgrounds move to the cities
and intermarry – which generally results in their children growing up speaking Indonesian
at home – the number of people who are competent in formal written Indonesian, and
the number of those who speak a colloquial variety of Indonesian in their daily lives,
will continue to increase even further. While this is a boon for the status and use of
Indonesian, it has the unfortunate side effect that many local languages are declining,
and some are disappearing altogether; much of the population has shifted to Indonesian
as a language of economic opportunity and wider communication. Linguists, both in
Indonesia and abroad, are concerned about this situation and are working with members
of smaller speech communities to document and describe many of these local languages.

12.3 **Structural Overview**

```
The purpose of this section is to offer a brief glimpse of Indonesian phonology, morphology,
and syntax, in order to give a general flavor of its structure. It will focus on features that may
be of particular interest to English-speaking students with no prior exposure to Indonesian.

Because Indonesian is a major
national language, there are many

**581 Language Profile 12 Indonesian**

```
12.3.1 Phonology
The pronunciation of Indonesian differs slightly from region to region, and varies consider-
ably based on whether the speaker is using formal or colloquial varieties. From a typological
perspective, and from the perspective of English-speaking learners of Indonesian, there is
nothing terribly “exotic” or “difficult” about pronouncing Indonesian. Like English, there
is no phonemic tone, and vowel length is not contrastive.
Owing primarily to the history of Portuguese and Dutch colonization, Indonesian is writ-
ten in the Latin alphabet, and there is a high letter-to-phoneme correspondence. In other
words, with only a few exceptions, non-speakers of Indonesian can pronounce it fairly
accurately simply by knowing which letter represents which phoneme. Most letters have
a pronunciation fairly close to the corresponding IPA symbols. The following are a few
exceptions: the letters c and j represent the voiceless and voiced
alveo-palatal affricates [ʧ] and [ʤ] respectively, e.g., baca [baʧa]
‘read’ and meja [meʤa] ‘table’; the letter y is used for the voiced
palatal approximant [j], e.g., yakin [jakin] ‘sure’; the letter r rep-
resents the alveolar tap [ɾ], which for some speakers and in some
words may be realized as a trill [r], e.g., baru [baru] ‘new’; rata-
rata [ɾatarata] ‘on average’; and the letter e is pronounced either
as [e] or [ə], e.g., bebek [bebeʔ] ‘duck,’ s e l e sai [sԥlԥsai] ‘finished,’
jendela [ʤəndela] ‘window.’
Syllable-final [p] and [t] are unreleased, e.g., map [mapʼn]
‘folder’, and syllable-final [k] is pronounced as a glottal stop [ݦ],

```

**582 Robert Englebretson**

```
e.g., baik [baiʔ] ‘good,’ pak [paʔ] ‘sir/Mr.’ Moreover, sequences of two identical vowels are
usually broken up by the insertion of a glottal stop, e.g., maaf [maʔaf] ‘pardon/excuse me,’
saat [saʔatࡘ] ‘moment.’ Primary stress generally falls on the penultimate (next-to-last) sylla-
ble – although there are some exceptions.
Three aspects of phonotactics may strike English speakers as both interesting and
tricky: (1) syllables may begin with [ŋ], e.g., ngeri [ŋəɾi] ‘scary’; (2) syllable onsets
may consist of a sequence of a nasal followed by a voiced stop, e.g., mbak [mbaʔ] ‘sis-
ter (term of address),’ ndak [ndaݦ] or nggak [ŋgaʔ] ‘no/not’ (colloquial); and (3) sylla-
bles may end with [h], e.g., rumah [ɾumah] ‘house,’ contoh [tʃontoh] ‘example,’ jatuh
[dʒatuh] ‘to fall.’
```
12.3.2 Morphology

```
Indonesian is primarily an isolating language, with very little in the way of inflec-
tional morphology. There is no verbal morphology for tense, aspect, or mood, and no
noun morphology for case, gender, or number. This has led to a common misconception
about Indonesian that it is a “simplified” language that is particularly easy to learn – a
false belief that James Sneddon, a noted scholar of Indonesian, refers to as the “myth of
simplicity” (Sneddon 2003 : 14–17). Indonesian makes productive use of reduplication,
and has morphology for voice (see below), as well as derivational morphology for nom-
inalization and other processes. For example, among its many functions, the suffix -an
may be used to derive nouns from (some) verbs: e.g., makan ‘eat’ > makanan ‘food’;
minum ‘drink (v.)’ > minuman ‘drink (n.)’; baca ‘read’ > bacaan ‘reading material.’
Reduplication is a word-formation process found in many languages of the world
(see Textbox LP12.2). In Indonesian reduplication is quite frequent, highly productive,
and has various meanings. Some words consist of a lexicalized reduplicated form – one
that cannot be further broken down into parts. For example, labah-labah is the word
for ‘spider,’ and the form *labah does not exist singly on its own to derive this word. (A
roughly analogous example from English is the word dodo , as in dodo bird, which is not
derived from the stem [do].) Other examples include kupu-kupu ‘butterfly,’ kura-kura ‘tur-
tle,’ pura-pura ‘pretend,’ and tiba-tiba ‘suddenly’ (although the verb tiba means ‘arrive’).
In current Indonesian orthography, reduplication is written out in full, with a hyphen
between the reduplicated elements (e.g., labah-labah ‘spider’). In older orthographies, and
currently in online communication such as internet chat and text messages, reduplication
is often written using the digit “2” to represent the reduplicated element (e.g., labah2
‘spider’). Full reduplication of a noun stem indicates something like a distributed plural
```
- an uncounted group of objects, e.g., _bunga_ ‘flower’ > _bunga-bunga_ ‘(lots of) flowers.’ A
reduplicated verb stem tends to indicate repeated or non-directed action, e.g., _jalan_ ‘walk’
> _jalan-jalan_ ‘stroll; go for a walk.’ When combined with other derivational morphology,
reduplication can have a number of idiomatic meanings. For example, reduplicating a
noun stem and adding the _-an_ nominalizing suffix (mentioned above) indicates that the
noun is a toy: _rumah_ ‘house’ > _rumah-rumahan_ ‘toy house, dollhouse’; _tikus_ ‘mouse’ > _tik-
us-tikusan_ ‘toy mouse’; _ayam_ ‘chicken’ > _ayam-ayaman_ ‘toy chicken, weather vane’; _mobil_
‘car’ > _mobil-mobilan_ ‘toy car.’


**583 Language Profile 12 Indonesian**

```
12.3.3 Syntax
The order of Indonesian’s major sentence constituents is typically SVO (the subject, fol-
lowed by the verb, followed by the object), although in natural conversation, both subjects
and objects are often unexpressed and inferred from context. Within the noun phrase,
adjectives, relative clauses, determiners, and quantifiers follow the nouns they modify,
while numerals precede them. Indonesian also uses prepositions.
One of the more interesting facts about Indonesian morphosyntax has to do with the
marking of voice on verbs (Textbox LP12.3 provides a general overview of voice construc-
tions). In formal Indonesian, transitive verbs take a prefix that marks them as being either
active voice , where the agent (the doer of the action) is the grammatical subject, or pas-
sive voice , where the patient (the undergoer of the action) is the grammatical subject.
The Indonesian active-voice prefix (glossed AV) has several allomorphs: mem- [məm], men-
[mən], or meng- [məŋ] (see Sidebar LP12.1). The Indonesian passive prefix (glossed PASS) is
di- [di] with no allomorphs. Consider the simple active sentence in Example (1).
```
### TEXTBOX LP12.2 REDUPLICATION

```
Reduplication is a morphological process found in
many languages, which creates words by repeating
all or part of a stem. In languages that make use of
full reduplication , the entire stem is repeated, as in
the Indonesian examples presented in the main text.
Another example of full reduplication comes from
Kayardild, a Tangkic language of Australia: kandu
‘blood’ > kandukandu ‘red.’ In languages that employ
partial reduplication , only a portion of the stem
is repeated; examples of partial reduplication from
other languages include other Austronesian languages
such as Pangasinan from the Philippines, which uses
reduplication for plurals: manók ‘chicken’ > manómanók
‘chickens’; toó ‘man’ > totoó ‘people.’ Some languages
have both full and partial reduplication.
Reduplication can convey both lexical and grammatical
meaning. Examples of reduplication with lexical meaning
include the Indonesian words presented above: labah-
labah ‘spider,’ kupu-kupu ‘butterfly,’ kura-kura ‘turtle,’
pura-pura ‘pretend,’ and tiba-tiba ‘suddenly.’ The
grammatical meanings encoded by reduplication cross-
linguistically include continuous or repeated action
```
```
(already illustrated above by the Indonesian word jalan-
jalan ‘to stroll; go for a walk’), plurality (similar to the
above Indonesian word bunga-bunga ‘lots of flowers’),
and augmentation in size and intensity (e.g., in color or
manner of action). Some examples of reduplication from
a number of languages follow:
Nez Perce, a Sahaptian language of the Northwestern
United States:
téӃmul ‘hail’ > temulté ː mul ‘sleet’
Tigak, an Austronesian language of Papua New Guinea:
giak ‘send’ > gigiak ‘messenger’
Choctaw, a Muskogean language of the Southern
United States:
tonoli ‘to roll’ > tononoli ‘to roll back and forth’
Mokilese, an Austronesian language of Micronesia:
roar ‘give a shudder’ > roarroar ‘be shuddering’ >
roarroarroar ‘continue to shudder’

```
The three forms mem- [məm],
men- [mən], and meng- [məŋ] are
allomorphs of a single morpheme.
Exercise 3 of this language profile
explores the rules that condition the
appearance of each allomorph.
```
```
In Example (1), Ali is the agent. The verb beli ‘buy’ is prefixed
with mem- (active voice), which tells us that the agent ( Ali ) is
also the grammatical subject of the sentence. The object noun
phrase consists of the head noun sepeda ‘bicycle’ preceded by
the numeral tiga ‘three’ and followed by the adjective baru ‘new’
and the demonstrative determiner itu ‘that/those.’ The sentence
concludes with the locative prepositional phrase di Jakarta ‘in
Jakarta.’ Contrast this with the passive sentence in Example (2).
```
```
Tiga sepeda baru itu di-beli Ali di Jakarta
three bike new DEM PASS-buy Ali LOC Jakarta
‘Those three new bicycles were bought by Ali in Jakarta.’
```
### (2)

```
Here, the prefix di- on the verb beli ‘buy’ indicates that the sentence is passive – that the
patient (‘those three new bicycles’) is the grammatical subject.
Indonesian voice and transitivity are far more complex and nuanced than can possibly be
illustrated in this language profile. Despite some apparent similarities to English active and
passive clauses, these Indonesian constructions actually encompass a broader range of dis-
course functions and semantic meanings, and there is debate over whether these should even
be called ‘active’ and ‘passive’ at all. In my other published works on Indonesian, I prefer to
use the terms agent-trigger and patient-trigger, respectively, and other Indonesianists prefer
the terms agent-focus and patient-focus; this reflects the fact that grammatical categories
often work very differently in different languages. Because of their broad range of functions,
it is often quite challenging for English speakers to learn to use Indonesian voice categories
with native-like fluency and idiomaticity. See the Suggestions for Further Reading section
for reference grammars that provide a more thorough discussion and additional examples.
```
```
The term voice refers to two or more syntactic
constructions that provide alternative mappings
between arguments and grammatical relations.
Section 6.4 briefly discussed active and passive voice
in English. Recall that in English the active voice is the
neutral construction, prototypically with the agent of
a transitive clause as the subject and the patient of a
transitive clause as the object:
[ The kids ] ate [ all the cookies ]
subject transitive verb object
agent patient
English passive voice differs from the active
grammatically in three ways: the verb is intransitive
and changes form (occurs with the auxiliary be and is
in the past participle form); the patient argument is
```
```
realized as the subject of the intransitive clause; and the
agent is either unexpressed or an oblique object of the
preposition by :
[ All the cookies ] were eaten ( by [ the kids ])
subject intransitive verb (oblique)
patient (agent)
There are other types of voice beyond active and
passive that are found in languages of different
typological profiles. (On the other hand, many
languages don’t have voice constructions at all.) The
different voice constructions are generally used to
move arguments that have important or given referents
into the prominent position of subject, or to move
unimportant or unknown referents out of the subject
position.

12.4 Language Planning
One of the most remarkable aspects of Indonesian has been its ascendance from being a
marginal “outside” language, spoken by less than 5 percent of Indonesia’s population in
1928, to its adoption as a high-status national language, with over 90 percent literacy among
Indonesia’s current population. Along with this dramatic increase in use, Indonesian has
also attained a symbolic status as a key part of the identity and soul of Indonesia itself –
part of being an Indonesian person is speaking the Indonesian language. This has come
about through well-organized language planning , in conjunction with sociopolitical cir-
cumstances that have led Indonesian people to adopt and legitimize it. Language planning
refers to the deliberate and systematic development of a language, usually through govern-
ment-sponsored institutions and policies. It is usually categorized into two types: (1) corpus
planning , that is, planning the body of the language – its writing system, its vocabulary
(usually through publishing an official dictionary), and its grammar – and (2) status plan-
ning , that is, propagating the language via education and media, shaping public attitudes
toward the language, and prescribing its role in society and the domains in which it is
used. This section will provide a cursory discussion of the history of Indonesian language
planning and will focus on spelling reform to illustrate key sociopolitical factors that
influence corpus planning. Interested readers should consult sources in the Suggestions for
Further Reading section for a more in-depth and thorough discussion than is possible here.
As explained earlier in this profile, the Indonesian archipelago is inhabited by several
hundred ethnic groups, who speak an estimated 300 distinct languages. When attempting
to bring this diversity together into the new Republic of Indonesia, leaders of the Indonesian
independence movement strongly believed that one single language should be chosen to
facilitate the unification process and to foster a united “Indonesian” identity. But consid-
erable debate emerged as to which language this should be. In terms of numbers of native
speakers, Javanese would have been the clear choice, since the majority of the population
lived on Java, and the Javanese were (and still are) the politically dominant and largest eth-
nic group within Indonesia. However, had Javanese been chosen as the national language,
other ethnic groups would have been disadvantaged and felt further isolated, which would
likely have undermined the entire unification process itself. Another suggestion was Dutch,
which many people viewed as a “modern” language, and which some educated Indonesians
could already speak. However, since Indonesia had been a Dutch colony for nearly 400
years, choosing the language of the colonizers, at the same time as fighting for independ-
ence from them, would have had clear, negative, symbolic and ideological consequences for
the newly independent nation. A third suggestion was English, which was also considered
a “modern” world language, and, in the context of Indonesian independence at least, did
not have the colonial baggage of Dutch. However, English was seen as too “foreign,” had no
history of use within Indonesia, and would not have been able to serve the founders’ goals
of developing a uniquely Indonesian identity.
Ultimately, at a 1928 meeting known as the Second Indonesian Youth Congress, lead-
ers of the Indonesian independence movement passed a resolution calling for the adop-
tion of a variety of Malay to serve as the national language of unification. They named
```

**586 Robert Englebretson**

```
this language Indonesian. The choice of a variety of Malay was successful for several
reasons. First, since less than 5 percent of the Indonesian population were speakers, no
single ethnic group was privileged; everyone had to learn it. Secondly, it did not bring
with it the ideological baggage of Dutch or other European languages that were associ-
ated with colonization and oppression. Thirdly, since Malay is an Austronesian language
genetically related to many of the languages of the archipelago, it did not seem as “for-
eign” as Dutch or English would have been. Finally, this variety of Malay, which was
primarily descended from literary Classical Malay, had already been used as an admin-
istrative language under the Dutch, and so was already familiar among native educators
and government officials.
After independence, government-sponsored agencies oversaw both corpus and status
planning, including the creation of new vocabulary to foster the use of Indonesian in mod-
ern scientific and technological contexts, publishing an official dictionary and grammar,
developing teaching materials, and conducting regular radio and television programs to
promote its use. The most recent editions of the official dictionary and grammar are listed
in the Suggestions for Further Reading section.
One issue that the Indonesian language planning situation clearly illustrates is that the
form and status of a language is intimately bound up with its political, cultural, and social
environment. Whether a language thrives (as with Indonesian) or, unfortunately, loses

```
speakers (as with many indigenous languages of Indonesia and
all over the world) strongly depends on macro-level factors such
as politics, power, and economics. Indonesian – and other world
languages like English, for that matter – owes its status and suc-
cess not to language-internal or structural factors, but rather to
the political forces that shape and promote it at an official level,
and to the economic and social factors at the individual level
that cause people to adopt or reject it. In the case of Indonesian, these have led to its accept-
ance and adoption by a culturally, ethnically, and linguistically diverse group of people.
Understanding the sociopolitical situation of a language and its speakers is a crucial com-
ponent of understanding how languages work, and of understanding why some languages
may thrive while others may become endangered.
The remainder of this profile presents a case study of Indonesian spelling reform, in order
to provide a concrete illustration of how corpus planning works, and to demonstrate a basic
linguistic fact about spelling systems more generally – namely, a language’s orthography is a
social convention that can be changed for political, linguistic, and practical reasons.
```
```
12.4.1 Spelling Reform
Nothing typifies prescriptive language ideologies better than social attitudes toward spell-
ing. From our earliest schooling, we are taught that there is generally only one “correct” way
to spell a word. American schoolchildren tend to have to take weekly spelling tests throughout
elementary and middle school, are penalized for not spelling words correctly, and are rewarded
for good performance in school-wide and national spelling bee contests. Society tends to sanc-
tion misspelling, treating it as a sign of ignorance or lack of intelli-
gence. We often think of a word’s spelling as immutable and final.
However, linguists recognize that orthography is simply a social
convention, and, like all social conventions, can be changed.
```
### SIDEBAR LP12.4

language is shaped by its political,
cultural, and social environment; see
especially Section 11.2.2.
```
### STOP AND REFLECT LP12.1 WHAT IS YOUR LINGUISTIC LANDSCAPE?

```
Public signs with multiple orthographic systems, such as that in Figure LP12.5, form part of the observable
linguistic culture of societies, sometimes referred to as “linguistic landscapes” (e.g., Shohamy and Gorter
2009). Consider your own physical environment. What scripts, orthographies, and/or writing systems can be
found in your community in public settings? Do the systems vary in terms of content delivered (e.g., graffiti
versus advertisements versus government messages)? Do you ever find multiple scripts or orthographic
systems for the same language (for example, when Chinese is written with the alphabet-based pinyin
rather than with characters)? What effect might the script, orthography, and language choice have on the
messaging? How do you think the linguistic landscape reflects and shapes the views of your community?
```
```
Spelling reform refers to a systematic change in the orthography for a given language. It
is an example of language planning, generally taking place in society from the top down; in
other words, educational or government institutions design and promote a new orthogra-
phy for a language, which publishers, print media, and individuals then adopt. Reasons for
spelling reform chiefly include ideological goals (to affiliate or disaffiliate with other nations

or political groups who may write the language in a certain way), linguistic or pedagogical
principles (to more closely reflect one letter per phoneme in an attempt to make the written
language more transparent and easier to learn; see Textbox LP12.4), or practical reasons (to
make the language easier to type or print given the current technology). Indonesian spell-
ing reform in the twentieth century reflects all three of these concerns.
Malay has a long written history, with stone inscriptions dating back to the seventh cen-
tury. The earliest Malay writing system was based on a Pali script (related to the script used
for Sanskrit), which was later replaced by the Arabic alphabet. Starting in the Dutch colo-
nial era, local officials began to write Malay using the Latin alphabet, which is the alpha-
bet still used today for writing Indonesian. However, during this period, spelling differed
from region to region, was not uniform, and was generally quite idiosyncratic. Then, in
1902, the Dutch education scholar Charles van Ophuijsen published the first standardized
national orthography for Indonesian Malay. This orthography was based primarily on the
pronunciation of literary Malay found in the Riau-Johor Sultanate (Riau is now a province
in Indonesia and Johor is now a state in the present-day Republic of Malaysia) and was
based on rules of spelling for the Dutch language. For example, in Dutch, the high back
rounded vowel [u] is spelled by the sequence of letters oe ; and van Ophuijsen prescribed oe
to spell [u] in Indonesian as well.

**589 Language Profile 12 Indonesian**

```
After Indonesian independence, two large-scale spelling reforms took place. The first, in
1947, formally known as Ejaan Republik ‘Republic spelling,’ clearly illustrates the political,
linguistic, and practical reasons for spelling reform. One major change was to abandon the
use of oe to spell [u], instead spelling it simply with the letter u. For example, the spelling
of the Indonesian word pronounced [buku] ‘book’ changed from boekoe (pre-1947) to buku
(current spelling); similarly, the spelling of [baru] ‘new’ changed from baroe (pre-1947) to
baru (current spelling) and [rumah] ‘house’ from roemah (pre-1947) to rumah. This spelling
reform was both a clear symbolic statement of independence from the Netherlands – no
more would Indonesian be bound by the idiosyncratic Dutch spelling of the vowel [u] – and
also an attempt to simplify spelling based on the principle of one letter per phoneme. While
this spelling change systematically applied to all Indonesian words containing [u], it raised
an interesting problem as to what to do about the spellings of names. Some people whose
name contained this vowel chose not to change the spelling of their name, while others
did. The print media sometimes kept the old spelling for the names of famous people, and
sometimes adopted the new spelling. For example, sometimes the names of Indonesia’s first
```
### TEXTBOX LP12.4 WHY ONE LETTER PER PHONEME?

```
We have seen (in Chapter 2) that the use of
orthographic representations, or spelling, to represent
the sounds of spoken language has many limitations.
In English, many written letters can represent more
than one possible sound. For example, the English
letter “c” can be used to represent two different
sounds: [k] as in cat and [s] as in ceiling. In contrast,
the single voiced velar nasal [ŋ] at the end of the
word ring is represented by a combination of two
letters, “ng.” In fact, some sounds of English, such
as the velar nasal [ŋ], are simply not represented by
single letters in the Roman alphabet.
Many people believe the English spelling system
may not be ideal for those learning to read and
write, and that it may be more efficient if learners
had an orthographic system that used one letter per
phoneme, i.e., one that used a single written symbol to
represent each sound. This is referred to as a ‘shallow
orthography’ and is exemplified by the orthographic
systems of languages such as Finnish and Spanish, or
by the hiragana syllabary in Japanese. Whereas other
languages (such as English and French) have greater
```
```
orthographic depth with complex spelling rules and
many irregular forms.
Why don’t all writing systems have one letter per
phoneme? Orthographic systems tend to be more
stable than spoken pronunciations over time. In other
words, whereas a language may undergo historical
sound changes, the orthography of the language is
more likely to stay the same, with the result that the
pronunciation begins to stray more and more from
the original written representation over time. For
example, the letter “r” is preserved in postvocalic
environments in written English even in dialects where
the corresponding phoneme hasn’t been pronounced
in that environment for years.
This exemplifies yet another complication that arises
from representing spoken language in writing: regional,
ethnic, and other socially based dialects of a language
often vary widely in pronunciation, and thus adopting
a shallow orthography may end up disadvantaging
speakers whose spoken variety does not already
approximate the standard.

two presidents are written Soekarno and Soeharto respectively, following the old spelling,
while other times they appear in print as Sukarno and Suharto , following the new system.
A second change brought about by the 1947 spelling reform was the abandonment of
the letter é to write the vowel [e]. Prior to 1947, é was used for [e] and e was used for [ə].
After 1947, both vowels are now written with the letter e. For example, [ʤəndela] ‘window’
is currently spelled jendela , where the e in the first syllable represents [ə] and the e in the
second syllable represents [e]. The main reason for the loss of the letter é was primarily due
to a desire to make the orthography easier to type using standard typewriters, and the fact
that this was the only letter in Indonesian written with an accent mark.
The second major spelling reform, known as Ejaan yang Disempurnakan ‘perfected spell-
ing,’ took place in 1972. This was a collaborative effort between Indonesia and Malaysia,
to unify the orthographies of both nations. On a political level, this reflected closer inter-
national relations between these two nations; on a linguistic level, unifying the spelling
systems meant that literature published in Malaysia could easily be read in Indonesia, and
vice versa. From the Indonesian perspective, major spelling changes took place at the level
of several consonants. For example, the pre-1972 spelling of [dʒ] and [tʃ] were dj and tj
respectively, which were then changed to j and c. Prior to 1972, the capital of Indonesia
[dʒakaɾta] was spelled Djakarta , and after 1972, the official spelling changed to Jakarta. Pre-
1972 medja ‘table’ and batja ‘read’ became meja and baca. Other consonant spelling changes
included changing the spelling of [j] from j to y , and changing the spelling of [x] (a voiceless
velar fricative) from ch to kh.
```
### CHAPTER SUMMARY

```
Indonesian is one of the world’s major languages. It has an unusual history directly
dependent on purposeful language planning, which has been remarkably successful.
Indonesian spelling reform provides a case study of corpus planning at work, as large-
scale, systematic changes were implemented that affect the writing system for the entire
language. Note that these changes apply to all Indonesian words containing the given
letters. For this reason, spelling reform is often expensive, as it requires the printing of
new signs, new maps, new dictionaries, and new textbooks, etc. Indonesian spelling
reform clearly illustrates that a language’s orthography is a social convention and can
change in response to political, linguistic, practical, and ideological concerns.

### EXERCISES

**1. Spelling in computer-mediated communication**
    This profile described spelling reform as a top-down process, in which educational or government
    institutions systematically design and promote a new orthography for a language. Another aspect related
    to spelling change, not discussed in this chapter, comes about through innovative spellings originating
    in certain types of media and/or socially defined groups of people. One aspect of contemporary society
    stereotypically associated with spelling innovations is computer-mediated communication (CMC), such as
    text messages and chats. Find fifteen examples of recent CMC that you have sent or received. In this body
    of data, identify each instance where the spelling is different from standard written English. Succinctly

characterize the differences between the CMC spelling and the standard spelling. What generalizations can
you make about the differences? What do you think motivates these innovative spellings? In your answer,
consider the medium of communication, as well as the social group(s) you most closely identify with.
```
**2. Spelling reform**
    In this profile, we saw that Indonesian underwent two major spelling reforms during the twentieth century,
    and we reviewed the reasons for some of these changes. For this exercise, consider the situation of English
    orthography. Write an essay in which you propose a large-scale spelling reform for English. What would
    you change from the current orthography, and why would you change it? Conclude your essay by carefully
    discussing both the advantages and the disadvantages of implementing such a proposal for English on an
       international scale.
       **3. Morphophonemics**
       In Section LP12.3.3 of this profile, we saw that a verb stem often takes
       a prefix to mark it as active voice. The active voice prefix has several
       allomorphs. Examine the following list of Indonesian verb stems and their
       active forms, written in Indonesian orthography, and answer the questions
       that follow. (The sequence _ng_ represents IPA [ŋ], _c_ is IPA [tʃ], _j_ is [ʤ], and _e_
       in the prefix is always [ə])
          Stem Active Gloss
       **a.** _ajar mengajar_ ‘teach’
       **b.** _antar mengantar_ ‘deliver (something)’
       **c.** _baca membaca_ ‘read’
       **d.** _bakar membakar_ ‘burn’
       **e.** _cari mencari_ ‘search’
       **f.** _curi mencuri_ ‘steal’
       **g.** _dengar mendengar_ ‘hear’
       **h.** _dorong mendorong_ ‘push’
       **i.** _gebuk menggebuk_ ‘beat (a drum)’
       **j.** _gonggong menggonggong_ ‘bark (of a dog)’
       **k.** _hilang menghilang_ ‘disappear’
       **l.** _isi mengisi_ ‘fill’
       **m.** _jual menjual_ ‘sell’
       **n.** _ulang mengulang_ ‘repeat’
    **i.** Based on the above data, list all the allomorphs of this Indonesian verbal prefix.
    **ii.** Write a general rule to account for the distribution of these allomorphs. Be sure to do this in terms of
       natural classes of sounds, rather than specific phonemes.
    **iii.** Which is the basic allomorph? Justify your answer.
    **iv.** What phonological process does this illustrate?
    Now consider the additional Indonesian data in (o–t) below:
       Stem Active Gloss
       **o.** _kacau mengacau_ ‘stir up (trouble)’
       **p.** _kenal mengenal_ ‘know (someone)’
       **q.** _panggil memanggil_ ‘call’
       **r.** _pukul memukul_ ‘hit’
       **s.** _tulis menulis_ ‘write’
       **t.** _tunggu menunggu_ ‘wait’
    **v.** Compare (o–t) with (a–n) above. Without doing anything to the rule you wrote in (ii) above, what
       additional statement needs to be made about the phonology of Indonesian verb stems and prefixes to
       account for these new data? Again, be sure to think in general terms of natural classes of sounds.
    **vi.** The rules you wrote in (ii) and (v) must occur in a certain order with respect to one another. State
       which rule must go first and which rule must go second, and explain how you know this. ( _Hint_ : Explain
       specifically what would happen if you put the rules in a different order.)

### SIDEBAR LP12.6

Note : For this exercise, you may want
to review the discussion of natural
classes (Section 3.1), allomorphy

**4. Language planning**
    The purpose of this exercise is to give you the chance to do some original library research of your own on
    a language not presented in this volume. Do some in-depth reading about language planning, and find
    out about it in places other than Indonesia. Three excellent cases to research are: Modern Hebrew in Israel,
    Irish in Ireland, or Hawaiian in the state of Hawai‘i. Some efforts at language planning have been highly
    successful, such as with Indonesian, and others have not. For one of the three languages listed above, write
    a paper in which you outline some of the reasons for the successes or failures of language planning policies.
    Be sure to consider how corpus planning and status planning were implemented; also consider why, in
    what domains of life, and to what extent, speakers chose to adopt or reject the use of the language.


**LANGUAGE PROFILE 13**

Seneca

13.1 **Introduction**

```
At the end of the fifteenth century, when Europeans began a serious invasion of the Western
Hemisphere, it was home to hundreds of distinct languages. North of the Rio Grande alone,
there were approximately 300 languages belonging to about fifty separate language fami-
lies. The first of these languages to be recorded in writing was spoken on the St. Lawrence
River near the present site of Quebec City. The French explorer Jacques Cartier made three
voyages to what is now eastern Canada beginning in 1534, and from those voyages we
know something about a language that was spoken in a place the French called Stadacona.
Among the words of the Stadaconan language was the name of a place, which the French
spelled canada , which meant simply ‘town’ or ‘settlement.’
Stadaconan turned out to be a language that was related to others within the Iroquoian
language family, named after the five (later six) nations of the Iroquois. All of those lan-
guages are believed to be descended from a common ancestor that must have been spoken
several thousand years ago. Linguists refer to that ancestor language as Proto-Iroquoian. In
addition to a number of languages in northeastern North America, many of which disap-
peared before the eighteenth century, the only other known member of the Iroquoian lan-
guage family is Cherokee, which was spoken by a large number of people in the southeastern

part of the United States. Most of the Cherokees were forced to
move to Indian Territory (now Oklahoma) during the admin-
istration of Andrew Jackson, although a few of them escaped
to the hills and managed to remain in western North Carolina.
Figure LP13.1 is a diagram of the Iroquoian language family.
The term Lake Iroquoian covers the six languages spoken in
the vicinity of the Great Lakes. At the time of first European
contact, the Tuscaroras lived in the eastern part of North Carolina. Early in the eighteen
century, they moved north to join their ancestors in the area of present-day New York
State, where they were adopted by the Five Nations to become the sixth Iroquois nation.
Huron lost its speakers in the nineteenth century, except that a divergent dialect known as
Wyandotte survived in Oklahoma until the 1960s.
The focus of this language profile, Seneca, is spoken now by fewer than fifty people on
three reservations (often now called territories) in western New York: Cattaraugus, Allegany,
and Tonawanda. Although it is endangered, there have been significant community efforts
to revitalize the language (see Textbox LP13.1).
Seneca is a name for these people that was adapted from the Dutch name Sinneken. The Dutch
applied that name to all the Iroquois nations west of the Mohawks, the immediate neighbors
of the Dutch in Fort Orange (now Albany). The English who succeeded the Dutch were fond
of classical references, as demonstrated by the many New York State place names like Rome

and Ithaca, not to mention small towns like Homer and Virgil. It was thus not surprising that
Dutch Sinneken was reinterpreted as Seneca , the name of two ancient Roman writers.
The Iroquois group just west of the Mohawks were the Oneidas, whose name refers to a
standing stone. It is possible that Sinneken began with an element sinn - meaning ‘stone’ in
some Algonquian (non-Iroquoian) language, to which the Dutch added their own dimin-
utive suffix -ken. In any case, as Europeans extended their knowledge of the Iroquois ever
farther west – to the Oneidas, Onondagas, Cayugas, and Senecas – the name Sinneken or
Seneca was eventually restricted to the westernmost Iroquois
group to which it is applied today. The languages are closely
related, to the extent that neighboring groups – the Mohawks
and Oneidas, or the Senecas and Cayugas – have little difficulty
understanding each other. On the other hand, the languages
that are more distantly separated – for example, the Mohawks
on the east and Senecas on the west – are not mutually intelligi-
ble. Mohawk, Oneida, Onondaga, Cayuga, and Seneca thus form
what is known as a dialect continuum.
```
### SIDEBAR LP13.2

For more on the concept of mutual
intelligibility and a schematization
of a dialect continuum, see the
discussion of Figure 1.1 in Chapter
1 and Section 12.4, on how dialects
arise and diverge into languages.
```
### TEXTBOX LP13.1 LANGUAGE REVITALIZATION

```
Although recent years have seen the number of
totally fluent speakers of the Seneca language
decline to fewer than one or two dozen individuals at
most, younger Senecas are now showing a renewed
interest in learning the language and passing it on
to future generations. Immersion in the language is
now provided in classes where practice in speaking
Seneca is showing significant results. Some younger
Senecas, furthermore, have successfully learned
ceremonial speeches that promise to keep their
```
```
use in ritual settings from disappearing. “Language
nests” in which older speakers interact in Seneca
with very young children are another promising
avenue through which the language is being
kept alive. Although Seneca may no longer be
used actively in day-to-day conversations, its use
in these other settings has been expanding and
promises to keep the language from disappearing.

13.2 **The Status of Unwritten Languages**

```
When Europeans first arrived in the Western Hemisphere, only some of the Maya and
Aztec languages of Central America had their own writing systems. Hundreds of other
languages had no written tradition. One sometimes encounters the naive view that
unwritten languages are inferior to those that are written, but writing is at best a recent
addition even to those languages that have such a system. This is not to say that writing
is unimportant; its ability to conquer time and space has produced revolutionary changes
in human history. But a language is a language, regardless of whether or not it is written.
People have been speaking for as long as they have been people, and until very recently in
human history, writing – if it existed at all – was confined to a small group of specialists.
Seneca was first written toward the end of the seventeenth century by a French Jesuit
missionary named Julien Garnier. He had a “good ear” and wrote with considerable accu-
racy, although like other Jesuits he failed to recognize the glottal stop, an important Seneca

consonant. Living among the Senecas between 1671 and 1709,
he compiled French–Seneca and Seneca–French dictionaries.
Parts of them were lost, but other parts have survived. During
the remainder of the eighteenth century, the language under-
went a number of changes in its sounds, the effect of which was
to create a language that is so different from its seventeenth-cen-
tury ancestor that modern Seneca speakers would have difficulty
understanding it. For example, the word for ‘bread’ in Garnier’s
time was ohráhkwa’ , which corresponds to modern äշ:hgwa’.
```
```
13.3 Seneca Phonology
13.3.1 Vowels
Seneca has eight vowels, which are often written today as shown in Table LP13.1. Two of
the vowels are nasalized, as indicated by the dieresis – ë and ö – the two dots above the
letters. The low front vowel ä is marked in the same way but is not nasalized. The vowel
u is limited to serving as a replacement for a in words indicating that something is tiny;
compare niyága’à:h ‘small girl’ and niyúgu’ù:h ‘tiny girl.’
Vowels in Seneca occur with three degrees of length. There is a short a in the last syllable
of ni:ga’ ‘how big I am,’ while in the same word, the colon indicates a long i in the first
syllable. There are also extra long vowels, written a:a as in the word gaga:a’ ‘story.’ Vowels
may also be pronounced with either a low or a high pitch. High-pitched or accented vowels
are written with an acute accent, as in gagá’da’ ‘white oak.’ Some long vowels have a falling
pitch, written with a grave accent as in à:hge:d ‘he might come.’
```
```
13.3.2 Consonants
Seneca has fifteen consonants, as shown in Table LP13.2. (Also see Sidebar LP13.4.) The
affricates ts, tš , and dz are written with two letters, but they function as single sounds. It
would be more consistent to write the voiced palatal affricate as dž , but j is preferred because
it reflects the usual English spelling of the same sound. The apostrophe (’) is used for the
glottal stop. Whereas in English h occurs only before a vowel, in Seneca it can also occur
after a vowel, as in the word à:hge:d at the end of the previous paragraph.

13.4 **A Seneca Narrative**

```
The following is a story that was told by Mrs. Elsie Jacobs, a Seneca woman who was eighty-
six years old at the time (see Textbox LP13.4 for more on Mrs. Jacobs). She prefaced the story
by asking her listener whether he had ever been haunted, and she proceeded to describe
what seemed to have been a supernatural event she had experienced when she was seven
years old. At that time she was living with her grandmother, but she frequently visited the
home of her mother, where this incident occurred.

### TEXTBOX LP13.4 MRS. ELSIE JACOBS

```
Mrs. Jacobs was born in 1908 on the Cattaraugus
Reservation, the oldest of six children. Not long after
the incident described here, her mother died during
the birth of her sixth child and Elsie was raised by her
grandparents, Ida and John Bluesky. Ida was Seneca
```
```
and spoke to Elsie in that language, but John, who is
mentioned in the story, was Cayuga and spoke to her
in English. She thus grew up fluent in both languages,
an advantage in a school where some of the children
entered speaking only Seneca.

### STOP AND REFLECT LP13.1 STRUCTURE OF A NARRATIVE

```
Section 9.6 presents the following elements of the conventional narrative schema: introduction of the
narrative; introduction of the participants; orientation in space; orientation in time; movement toward a
climax; the climax; reaction to the climax; results of the climax; coda. Does Mrs. Jacobs’ story have all of these
elements? Which lines of the story realize which parts of the narrative?
```
```
13.4.1 The Influence of English
When this story was recorded, everyone in the community spoke
English most of the time and there were very few people who held
extended conversations in Seneca. Mrs. Jacobs showed the influence of
English in several places. Line 4 contains an example of what linguists

see Section 11.2.3.

```
call codeswitching. The beginning and end of the sentence were in English but the verb
in the middle was in Seneca:
```
**(4)** _That John hotgwe:nyö:h, at Indian Fair._
he has won it
‘That John had won at the Indian Fair.’

```
The English at the end of line 7 is another example:
```
**(7)**
_Da:ho:nëh nä:h wa’ágwatgá:nye:’_ , _dayagwajë:’ gë:s at the top of the steps_
so then! we played we sat down there repeatedly
‘So then we played, we sat down there at the top of the stairs.’

```
Two sentences later, however, in line 9, the same idea was expressed with a Seneca word:
```
```
In line 12, Mrs. Jacobs said Gram rather than Akso:d , the Seneca word for grandmother
that she used elsewhere:
```
**(12)**

### TEXTBOX LP13.4 SENECA’S INFLUENCE ON ENGLISH

```
Not only has Seneca been influenced by English, but
English has been influenced by Seneca, too. Borrowing
from Seneca into English is particularly evident in place
names; two of the fifty US states have Seneca names:
Kentucky and Ohio. The first is an English interpretation
of Seneca Gëdá’geh ‘at the field.’ The second originated
```
```
as the name of the Ohio River, derived from Seneca
Ohi:yo:h ‘beautiful river,’ a stretch of water that
includes both the Allegany (or Allegheny) River and its
continuation at Pittsburgh as the Ohio. It is also the
name of the Allegany Reservation, but with a final glottal
stop that is often found on proper names: Ohi:yo’.
```
**(9)** (^) _Ta’gë:’öh nä:h ne’hoh dödà:da’t neh nyágwai’ gä_ ́ _:’töshä_ ́ _gë:ya:d._
after a while! there he stood there the bear at the top of the stairs
‘After a while the bear stood there at the top of the stairs.’
_Da:h o:nëh wa’ödadí:nö:g né:wa’ neh Gram_ , _wa’e:gë’ hä:’gwah._ ́
so then she called to her this time the she saw it too
‘So then she called Gram, she saw it too.’
Codeswitching may also occur within a single word. In Line 6, the English _trunk_ was fol-
lowed by the Seneca suffix _-geh_ , translatable as ‘on’: _trunkgeh_ ‘on the trunk.’ In Line 13, the
influence of English is more obscure in the word _gasdò:shä̗k’ah_ ‘next to the stove,’ but in
fact _-sdò:-_ in the middle of that word was borrowed from English _stove._ The Seneca word for
‘stove’ alone is _gasdò:shö’_ , with the neuter prefix _ga-_ and the noun-forming suffix _-shä’._ Here
it was followed by the verb root _-k’ah_ ‘be next to.’ There is an alternative, entirely Seneca
word for ‘stove’ – _ganö̗hsodàià’shä’_ , literally ‘that which heats the house,’ but Mrs. Jacobs
chose the half-English version. (See Textbox LP13. for a note about Seneca’s influence on
English.)


**603 Language Profile 13 Seneca**

```
13.5 Polysynthesis and Fusion
Europeans who first encountered polysynthetic languages like Seneca liked to say that
they could express within a single word a thought that in English or another European
language would require an entire phrase or even an entire sentence. The second word in
line 1 of Mrs. Jacob’s story, reproduced below, tšiwágoshíya’göh , means literally ‘when I have
crossed winters’ – five words in English. Its parts include:
```
```
(1)
```
### SIDEBAR LP13.6

```
See Section 4.8 for more on
polysynthetic versus isolating or
analytic languages. For examples
of other polysynthetic languages,
see the Language Profiles on
Nuuchahnulth (LP5) and South
Conchucos Quechua (LP6).
```
```
tši- wág- -osh- -íya’g- -öh
when- I- -winter- -cross- -PERFECT
```
```
Crossing winters is the idiomatic way Seneca expresses the idea of being a certain age; hence the
free translation ‘when I was seven years old.’ Winters in the Northeast of North America were
severe, and surviving one was a salient achievement by which the passage of years was meas-
ured. The “perfect” suffix locates the crossing of winters as an event that occurred in the past but
was still relevant, so the equivalent in English would be I have crossed (a certain number of winters).
As we have seen in these types of examples, Seneca words can contain a large number of
morphemes. Moreover, the language has undergone a large number of sound changes whose
effect has often been to obscure the boundaries between those mor-
phemes. Languages of this type are called not only polysynthetic but
also fusional , with separate morphemes fused together.
This process is evident in the word gä̗:’t ë shä̗g ë :ya:d ‘at the top of the
stairs’ in line 9 above, which is difficult to segment into discrete mor-
phemes because the morphemes have been fused together through
processes of historical sound change, as discussed in Textbox LP13.4.
Some shorter words in Seneca hide more complexity than is
evident on the surface. In line 2 above, ho’ka:’ ‘I took it there’ is
the modern pronunciation of a word that was once pronounced
*hwa’khaw’. Over time, the first syllable, hwa’- , was replaced by ho’ -,
the kh sequence was reduced to k , and the w in the last syllable was
dropped with compensatory lengthening of the preceding a ; thus
today we have ho’ka:’.
```
### TEXTBOX LP13.4 SOUND CHANGE LEADING TO FUSION

```
Several centuries ago, the word gä ́ :’tëshä ́ gë:ya:d ‘at
the top of the stairs’ would have been pronounced
*gará’dëshrágëhyad ; the asterisk shows that this is
a reconstructed pronunciation from the past. At
that time, under certain conditions, vowels in even-
numbered syllables were accented – in this case
syllables 2 and 4. The sequence ra in the second
and fourth syllables was replaced by rä , producing
*garä ́ ’dëshrä ́ gëhyad , and later the r dropped out,
leaving *gaä ́ ’dëshä ́ gëhyad. The vowel sequence aä
at the beginning of that word coalesced into a long
```
```
ä ́ : , leaving *gä ́ :‘dëshä ́ gëhyad. At some point the h
in the next-to-last syllable also dropped out with
compensatory lengthening of the preceding vowel, and
the a in the final syllable was lengthened as well. Thus,
today we have the pronunciation gä ́ :’dëshä ́ gë:ya:d :
Original pronunciation *gará’dëshrágëhyad
ra -> rä *garä ́ ’dëshrä ́ gëhyad
r deletes *gaä ́ ’dëshä ́ gëhyad
aä -> ä: *gä ́ :’dëshä ́ gëhyad
h deletes; vowels lengthen gä ́ :’dëshä ́ gë:ya:d

```
13.5.1 The Predominance of Verbs

```
As with the other Northern Iroquoian languages, Seneca uses verbs to a far greater
extent than English and other European languages. In fact, exaggerating only slightly,
a nineteenth-century missionary among the Mohawks wrote, “In their language almost
everything is a verb” (Cuoq 1866). Perhaps the most salient feature of Seneca verbs is their
inclusion within a single word of both an event and a participant in the event. Such a
word can then be used to refer either to the event itself or to the participant. Thus, one
possible translation of the verb hay ë : t was is ‘he plants,’ a habitual event, but the same
word can also be used to refer to a man who does the planting: a ‘planter,’ ‘gardener,’ or
‘farmer.’
Not only do Seneca verbs include information on the participants in events, they are also
subject to modifications of the basic meaning that are expressed by derivational suffixes
following the verb base. The element meaning ‘plant’ appeared as the base -y ë twa- of the
word hayɺ:twas. But this base itself is composed of the root -y ë t- with the meaning ‘be set in
place’ followed by a derivational suffix -w- that means ‘cause to.’ Thus, the meaning ‘plant’
is derived from ‘cause to be set in place.’ To this base can be added a number of further
modifications, which at the same time trigger changes in the form of the habitual aspect
suffix at the end. These are given in Table LP13.3.
```
13.5.2 Noun Incorporation

```
Another feature of polysynthetic languages that adds to their complexity is noun incor-
poration : the addition of a noun root to modify the meaning of the verb root (see Stop
and Reflect LP13.2). In line 1 in the story above, we saw the incorporation of -osh- ‘winter’
with the verb root -iya’g- ‘cross’ to express the idea of crossing winters. Another example of
incorporation occurred at the very end of the story in line 21, in the word gaga:is , either ‘it’s
a long story’ or ‘the length of the story.’ Here the noun root -gar- ‘story’ was incorporated
```

**605 Language Profile 13 Seneca**

```
with the verb root -is ‘be long.’ The earlier form *gagaris acquired a long vowel in the next
to last syllable, *gaga:ris , and then the r was lost to produce gaga:is. This word illustrates
how the same word can be used for a state, ‘it’s a long story,’ or for something that is in that
state, ‘the length of the story.’
```
### STOP AND REFLECT LP13.2 NOUN INCORPORATION

```
Noun incorporation is similar to compounding in that two separate roots, stems, or words are combined
into one; however, in this case, a noun root is used to modify a verb root, resulting in a verb. Often the
modification of the verb by the noun serves to make the meaning of the verb more specific.
Noun incorporation also occurs in English and can be seen in verbs such as bartend (which incorporates the
noun bar ), and babysit (incorporating the noun baby).
Think of five other examples of noun incorporation in English. What is the semantic case role of the noun in
each case?
```
```
13.5.3 Pronominal Prefixes
All of the verbs in Seneca, and many of the nouns, include a so-called pronominal prefix that
specifies the gender, number, and role of one or more participants in an event or state, or
(with a noun) the possessor of an object. In line 1 above, both of the verbs, tšiwágoshíya’gäh,
o’dwagajɺönyö:s ‘when I had crossed winters, I got haunted’ contain a prefix -wag- that cor-
responds to the English pronoun I. In line 2, the verb ho’ka:’ ‘I took it there’ also contains
an element translated ‘I,’ but in this case the prefix is -k- rather
than -wag-. This -k- is the form taken by a first-person prefix that
specifies someone who performs an action, called an agent.
The -wag- prefix in the first two verbs, on the other hand, is
used when someone is affected by an event, called a patient.
Someone who has ‘crossed winters’ is regarded as affected by the
experience, as is a person who gets haunted.
In lines 5 and 6 of the story, we have the verbs wa’ágwatgánye:’ ‘we played’ and wa’ög-
wagɺ̖:’dɺ’ ‘we got tired.’ The first contains the ‘first-person plural agent’ prefix -agwa-: the
agent of the playing. The second contains the ‘first-person plural patient’ prefix -ögwa-.
Someone who gets tired is assigned to the patient role. We can line up the four prefixes
described so far as in Table LP13.4.
```
```
TABLE LP13.4 Some first-person prefixes in Seneca
```
```
Singular Dual Plural
Agent -g- or -k- -(y)agya- -(y)agwa-
Patient -wag- -(y) ö gya- -(y) ö gwa -
```
### SIDEBAR LP13.8

```
For the description of another system
of agent–patient cross-referencing on
the verb, see the Lowland Chontal
Language Profile, Section LP9.2.2.
```

**606 Wallace Chafe**

```
In the upper left cell of Table LP13.4, -g- appears before vowels and -k- before (most) con-
sonants. Although the k in ho’ka:’ ‘I took it there’ appears to be followed by a vowel, we saw
that this word was earlier pronounced *hwa’khaw’ , where the k was followed by an h and
hence pronounced k rather than g. In the dual and plural columns, the initial y was dropped
after a glottal stop, as in the examples above. We can see this y in line 14, da’sayagyáhdɺ:di’
‘we (dual) didn’t go home’; in line 7, dayagwajɺ:’ ‘we (plural) sat down there’; and with a
patient prefix in line 14, niyö̗gyahjö̗’oh ‘how scared we were.’
It is also possible for an agent to be combined with a patient
within a single transitive prefix. In line 16, o’shágwa:owi’ ‘we told
him’ contains the transitive prefix -shagwa- , which combines a
first-person plural agent with a masculine singular patient: ‘we
(did something to or for) him.’ With the same verb root, a few
other possibilities are: o’shö̗gwa:owi’ ‘he told us’ and o’ké:owi’ ‘I
told her.’ In all there are sixty-seven of these pronominal prefixes,
including intransitive agents and patients and transitive combina-
tions of them. The following are some combinations with a masculine singular agent, ‘he,’
attached to the verb stem -nöe’s ‘like.’ Dual means ‘two’ and plural means ‘three or more.’
```
```
hakn ö́ e’s ‘he likes me (singular)’
shökninöe’s ‘he likes us (dual)’
shögwánöe’s ‘he likes us (plural)’
yan ö́ e’s ‘he likes you (singular)’
shesninöe’s ‘he likes you (dual)’
sheswánöe’s ‘he likes you (plural)’
hon ö́ e’s ‘he likes him’
shagónöe’s ‘he likes her’
hag ö́́ nöe’s ‘he likes them’
The following combinations have a masculine singular patient:
```
```
hen ö́́ e’s ‘I like him’
shehninöe’s ‘we (dual inclusive) like him’
shedwánöe’s ‘we (plural inclusive) like him’
shakninöe’s ‘we (dual exclusive) like him’
shagwánöe’s ‘we (plural exclusive) like him’
hesn ö́́ e’s ‘you (singular) like him’
shesninöe’s ‘you (dual) like him’
sheswánöe’s ‘you (plural) like him’
höw ö́ nöe’s ‘she or they like him’
```
```
There are two things to notice in this last set. In one respect Seneca makes more distinc-
tions than English does, but in another respect it makes fewer. There are four different ways
of translating the English pronoun we when it combines an agent with a masculine singu-
lar patient. The group covered by ‘we’ may be dual or plural, and it may be inclusive or
exclusive. An inclusive ‘we’ includes the person being talked to, the listener. Inclusive dual
is like saying ‘you and I,’ and inclusive plural includes ‘you and I and some other people.’
An exclusive ‘we’ excludes the person being talked to: ‘we’ but not including ‘you.’
```
### SIDEBAR LP13.8

```
Orthographic note: in the
combination [ sh ] the [ s ] and [ h ]
are pronounced separately, not
as the single sound spelled sh in
English.
```

**607 Language Profile 13 Seneca**

```
The other thing to notice is that in the last word, höwö̗nöe’s ‘she or they like him,’ no
distinction is made between a single female, ‘she,’ and plural third person, ‘they.’ This
absence of a distinction between ‘she’ and ‘they’ appears in other transitive prefixes as well.
It exemplifies the manner in which cultural practices sometimes influence language. In
ancient Iroquois society men and women had very different roles. Writing of the Hurons,
one anthropologist wrote that:
```
```
the most basic distinction in Huron society was that made between the sexes ... Almost
every task was considered to be either exclusively men’s work or exclusively women’s work,
and every Huron was expected to be familiar with all or most of the tasks appropriate to
his or her sex. For the most part, men engaged in tasks that required considerable physical
strength, or which took them away from home for long periods. Women performed tasks of
a more routine nature that kept them in, or close to, their villages ... In addition to hunting
and fishing, clearing land, building houses, and manufacturing tools, the major activities
that men engaged in were trading, waging war, and government. (Trigger 1976: 34, 45)
```
```
Gender roles were distributed in Iroquois society in such a way that men were conspicuous
and flamboyant, while women stayed in the background. Their position, however, was one
from which women influenced what men did in fundamental ways. Rather than being
unimportant or undervalued, women were responsible for keeping life going, both from
day to day and from generation to generation.
```
```
Descent was traditionally traced through the women, land belongs to the women, and
chiefs are appointed by the women – who theoretically can depose them at will. This means
that female children are important to a family, the opinions of women carry weight, and
women have some legal and political power. (Richards 1974: 401)
```
```
The foregrounded role of men and the backgrounded but powerful role of women are mir-
rored in a pronominal prefix system that elaborates masculine gender while it integrates
women with people in general.
```
```
13.5.4 Verbs, Nouns, and Particles
Viewed in terms of their internal structure, Seneca words fall into three major classes: verbs,
nouns, and particles. Verbs consist minimally of a pronominal prefix, a verb base, and an
aspect suffix, but there are many ways in which that simple structure may be expanded,
as we saw above. Nouns usually consist of little more than a pronominal prefix, a noun
base, and a noun suffix. Mrs. Jacobs’ story contained only one example of a morphological
noun: gayá’da’ ‘doll’ (line 2). It is built on the noun root -ya’t- , which refers more generally
to a ‘body’ but is also used for a doll. It is preceded by the neuter prefix ga- and followed
by the generalized noun suffix -a ’. In line 5, this word occurred in its distributive version
gayá’da’shö̗’öh ‘dolls.’ The -shö’öh suffix is called distributive rather than plural because it
implies not only that there were several dolls but also that these dolls were of different
types, one being a teddy bear and others of other kinds.
Mrs. Jacobs’ story contained 128 words, of which thirteen were English. Of the 115 Seneca
words, only two were nouns as described in the paragraph above. One word, ha’nih ‘father’
```

**608 Wallace Chafe**

```
belongs to a small subset of kinship terms that have their own unique structure, contrasting
in that respect with akso:d ‘grandmother,’ which is actually a verb. That leaves 42 verbs and
70 words that belong to the diverse class of particles : words with no internal structure or,
in a few cases, a very simple and often idiosyncratic structure. Particles perform a number
of different functions, which can be assigned to the following rough categories:
```
```
t Numerals : The first word in Mrs. Jacobs’ story was the numeral dza:dak ‘seven.’ (See Textbox
LP13.5 for other numerals in Seneca.)
t Kinship terms : Also in line 1 was no’y ë^ ́ :neh ‘at mother’s,’ composed of no’y ë h ‘mother’ (in lines
11 and 18 ) plus the locative suffix -neh.
t Animals : A number of animal names, such as nyagwai’ ‘bear’ (lines 2, 9 , and 17 ) have no obvious
internal structure, as is the case with ji:yäh ‘dog,’ gwa’y ö́ :’ ‘rabbit,’ and others.
t Pronouns : Line 2 contains the first-person pronoun i:’ , which can mean ‘I,’ ‘we,’ ‘me,’ or ‘us.’ The
second-person pronoun is i:s ‘you.’
t Temporal adverbs : Conspicuous in this text is the adverbial particle o:n ë h ‘then’ (lines 5, 7 , 10 ,
12 – 14 , and 16 – 20 ) expressing succession in time. A more specific temporal location is provided
by né:wa’ ‘this time’ (line 12). An event that occurs a number of times is signaled by g ë :s ‘repeat-
edly’ (lines 7 and 8 ). A passage of intervening time is signaled by ta’g ë :’öh ‘after a while’ (line 9).
t Spatial adverbs : The most general indicator of a specific location is ne’hoh ‘there’ (lines 9 and
21 ). The little word heh ‘there’ (line 15) is limited to particular expressions. Vertical location is
signaled by he’tg ë h ‘above’ (line 5).
t Article : The particle neh (lines 2, 9 , 11 , 12 , 14 , 15 , 17 – 19 , and 21 ) can often be translated as the
English definite article ‘the,’ although it has more uses as well.
t Epistemics : Native American languages tend to be more concerned than European languages
with the source and evaluation of the knowledge that is being communicated. There are two
epistemic particles in Mrs. Jacobs’ account. When one is telling about something one has not
witnessed directly, it is common to insert the hearsay particle gyö’öh (line 17), absolving oneself
of direct responsibility for the information. The other particle in this category is do:g ë s ‘really’
(line 21), expressing certainty about what happened.
t Limiter : The particle shö:h ‘just’ (lines 18 and 21 ) indicates that the information conveyed was
the only possibility.
t Intensifier : The particle nä:h (lines 5– 7 , 9 , 10 , 13 , 16 , and 18 – 21 ), which is translated here with
an exclamation point (!), corresponds to saying something in English with greater emphasis.
Here it appeared most often in the fixed expression Da:h o:n ë h nä:h ‘so then,’ which began
many of the sentences (lines 5, 7 , 10 , 13 , 16 , and 18 – 20 ). It corresponds to pronouncing the
word ‘then’ with higher pitch and greater loudness.
t Connectives : Finally, there are several particles that logically connect what preceded with what
follows. The most common is da:h ‘so’ (lines 5, 7 , 10 , 12 , 13 , 16 , and 18 – 21 ). The particle koh
‘and’ (line 2) is placed after the connected item rather than before, as in English: akso:d i:’ koh
‘grandmother and I.’ Similar in function is hä ́ :’gwah ‘also’ (lines 11, 12 , and 16 ). Finally, there is
the temporal conjunction ga:nyo’ ‘when’ (line 6), which is less tightly integrated with the event
than the prefix tši- in tšiwágoshiշya’göh ‘when I had crossed winters’ (line 1).

### CHAPTER SUMMARY

```
We have seen something of the history of the Seneca language and the features that assign
it to the polysynthetic and fusional language type. Mrs. Jacobs’ narrative provided a basis
for illustrating some of the basic elements of Seneca structure, especially the predominant
role of verbs and the way verbs can be expanded to modify the nature of events and
states. Although complex verbs are the principal means of expressing ideas, the last
section described some of the variety found in the ubiquitous particles that modify the
flow of discourse.

14.1 **Historical Background**

```
Akkadian is a Semitic language that is no longer spoken, but which is related to the living
Semitic languages Arabic, Amharic, Hebrew, and Aramaic. Akkadian is one of the earliest
attested languages, surpassed in this respect only by Sumerian and Ancient Egyptian. It was
spoken in ancient Mesopotamia (a term which refers to the land
“between the rivers,” or between the Euphrates and the Tigris),
in an area roughly corresponding to today’s Iraq.
The first written records in Akkadian date from around 2500
BCE, and the language continued to be spoken until around 500
BCE, when it was displaced by Aramaic. Nevertheless, texts in
Akkadian continued to be written for several more centuries.
The Akkadian language thus has a written history spanning
more than two thousand years, almost twice as long as that of
English. During this period, the language underwent consider-
able changes. However, some of the basic traits of its grammar, such as the remarkable
root-and-template architecture of the verbal system, which we shall explore in more detail
below, have characterized Akkadian throughout its history.
The name of the language derives from the city of Akkade which was founded in the
twenty-third century BCE as the imperial capital of the first “world conqueror,” King
Sargon. After 2000 BCE, Akkadian diverged into two main varieties: Babylonian, which was
spoken in the south of Mesopotamia in an area dominated by the city of Babylon (today
south of Baghdad), and Assyrian, which was spoken in the north. The Babylonians and
Assyrians dominated the political and cultural horizon of the Ancient Near East up until the
sixth century BCE. Their political dominance may have waxed and waned, but for a good
part of two thousand years, Mesopotamian emperors would rule over “the four corners” (of
the earth). From Sargon in the third millennium BCE to Sennacherib and Nebuchadnezzar
in the first, these emperors would lay claim to the title “King of the Universe.” More stable
than the power of the sword, however, was the cultural hegemony of Mesopotamia over the
whole region. The Akkadian language shaped the dominant canon for much of the Near

East in terms of religion, the arts, science, and law. And the cuneiform (‘wedge-shaped’)
writing system, which Akkadian speakers had originally borrowed from their Sumerian
neighbors, was exported far and wide, and adapted as the script of many diverse languages,
from Hittite to Elamite, and from Hurrian to Ancient Persian. Akkadian itself was used as
a lingua franca throughout the Near East, and was the means of diplomatic correspond-
ence. Languages across the Near East also borrowed many scien-
tific and cultural terms from Akkadian, a few of which may even
be recognized by English speakers today. For instance, the first
word in the Jewish expression mazel tov (‘luck good’ in Hebrew)
is a borrowing from the Akkadian astrological term mazzaltu ,
which meant the position of a star in the sky.
After millennia of cultural supremacy, however, Assyria was defeated and Babylon
soon followed suit, finally finished off by the Persians. The sixth century BCE ushered
in an age of rapid decline, so that within a few centuries both the Akkadian language
and its writing system fell into oblivion. Hundreds of thousands of clay tablets, the
product of two thousand years of civilization, lay forgotten in the desert sands for two
more millennia, to be rediscovered and deciphered only in the nineteenth century. Since

then, an incredible wealth of texts has been recovered from
the soil of Iraq and neighboring countries and has opened
up a unique perspective into one of history’s greatest civili-
zations. The texts encompass many genres, including poetry
(such as the Epic of Gilgamesh), legal documents (such as the
Code of Hammurabi), religious incantations, royal inscrip-
tions of heroic deeds, diplomatic correspondence, everyday
letters between individuals, monolingual and multilingual
dictionaries, mathematical and astronomical texts, medical
treatises, school exercises, and a seemingly endless quantity
of administrative documents, from real estate contracts to lists
of workers’ food rations. One reason for such an abundance of
surviving materials is that the texts were written not on paper,
but on wet clay tablets, using a triangular-shaped wedge. And
clay, once dried, is highly durable; thus, there are hundreds of thousands of tablets that
have been recovered, and thousands more yet to be unearthed.
```
14.2 **The Writing System**

```
The cuneiform writing system was developed toward the end of the fourth millennium
BCE by the Sumerians, the earlier inhabitants of southern Mesopotamia. In the middle of
the third millennium BCE, Akkadian speakers borrowed the script and adapted it to write
their own language. Figure LP14.2 is a hand copy of a clay tablet from the British Museum,
which contains a letter from around 1800 BCE. The letter begins, “Tell my lord, this is what
your maid Tatnjr-mƗtum said: May (the gods) Šamaš and the bride Aya keep you well forever
for my sake. Concerning the fish and the locusts that I told you about, don’t forget them.
Bring them with you.”
The cuneiform script is rather complex, because it used both syllabograms (phonetic
signs that represent syllables or parts of syllables, represented in modern transliterations
by small letters, e.g., ma, an, nam , etc.) and logograms (whole-word signs, represented
in modern transliterations by capitals, e.g., GÉME – ‘maid’). In the first line of the text in
Figure LP14.2, for example, all the signs are to be read phonetically (see Textbox LP14.1 for
transcription notes). But in line 3, the third sign from the right is the logogram GÉME. Since
the logograms were borrowed from Sumerian, modern transliterations represent these log-
ograms according to their Sumerian rather than Akkadian pronunciations. The Akkadian
pronunciation of the word ‘maid’ was actually amat , so the word transliterated as GÉME-
ka-ma was actually pronounced amatkama ‘your maid.’ A further complication is that some
logograms were not meant to be pronounced at all, but were ‘determinatives’ that specified
which type of noun followed them. The first sign in line 4 (DINGIR) is a logogram for ‘god,’
showing that a god’s name is to follow (in this case the Sun god, called Utu in Sumerian and
Šamaš in Akkadian).

14.3 **The Consonantal Roots of Akkadian (and Other Semitic
Languages)**
In Chapter 4, we saw that morphemes do not always have to be pieces of words such as pre-
fixes or suffixes. In the English nouns _man/men_ and _goose/geese_ , for example, plurality is not
marked by a suffix but rather by a change of vowel inside the word itself. Similarly, English
verbs such as _drink/drank_ mark the past tense not by a suffix _-ed_ , but by an internal vowel
change. In English, such marking of grammatical categories in
this way is restricted to a few odd nouns and a few irregular
verbs. (There are also some relics of a causative pattern marked
by an internal vowel alternation, e.g., _fall–fell_ ‘make fall,’ _sit–set_
‘make sit,’ _rise–raise_ , etc.) But there are languages where such
internal vowel alterations are far more widespread and far more
systematic. The Semitic verb offers one of the most elaborate and sophisticated examples of
such vowel alterations among the world’s languages. The vowels change so much, in fact,
that they are not deemed to be a part of the verbal root at all. The verbal root in the Semitic
languages is generally described as consisting only of consonants. The Akkadian root for ‘to

```
put’ or ‘to place’ is š-k-n, and the root for ‘to cut’ or ‘to block’ is p-r-s. This consonantal root
is an abstract notion, of course, because it is not pronounceable as such, and never appears
in this way in practice. The consonantal root comes to life only when it is superimposed on
a template , which is a pattern of vowels (and sometimes additional consonants) that has
three empty slots for the three consonants of the root. To take one example, the Akkadian
template i ۵۵ u ۵ denotes the past tense in the third-person masculine, so if we insert the
root š-k-n into the template, we get:
```
```
Root: š-k-n
Template: i u
iškun
```
```
(past tense, third-person masculine)
(‘he placed’)
```
```
Root: p-r-s
Template: a
rsaa
```
```
ia
irp
```
```
(present tense, third-person masculine)
(‘he blocks’)
```
```
A different template i ۵ a ۵۵ a ۵ forms the present tense. Here, in addition to the vowels
that appear between the root consonants, the second root consonant is also doubled, or
geminated. So if we insert the root p-r-s into the template, we get:
```
```
There are a very large number of such templates in Akkadian (and in other Semitic lan-
guages), and they are used to mark all manners of verbal distinctions. For example, different
templates denote the different tenses, aspects, moods, and other inflectional categories of
the verb. Here are a few examples of templates. Look at their structures, and then try out
Stop and Reflect LP14.1:
```
```

```
### STOP AND REFLECT LP14.1 PRACTICE WITH TEMPLATES

```
Use the templates listed and the root š-k-n ‘to place’ to figure out the words for ‘he will place,’ ‘place (it)!,’
and ‘to place.’
```
```
Notice that in addition to different vowels between the root consonants and gemination
(doubling of a consonant, as in the present-tense template above), sometimes there are
consonants which are included as part of the templates themselves. The perfect tense, for
instance, has a t infix as part of the template.
```

**617 Language Profile 14 Akkadian**

```
This algebraic-seeming template system is not just an artifice of our description.
Experiments have shown that both the consonantal roots and the templates have psy-
chological reality for speakers of Semitic languages. To put it simply, while to English ears,
forms which have no vowels in common, such as parsum (verbal adjective), iprus (past), or
iparras (future) all sound quite dissimilar, for speakers of Semitic languages, such forms are
perceived as closely related variations on a theme: the consonants p-r-s.
The template system is far richer than what has been presented so far, because in addition
to the basic distinctions of tense, mood, and aspect presented above, different templates are
also used to mark other nuances of the action such as passive, causative, reflexive, intensive,
iterative (repeated or habitual action). Here are several examples of these:
```
```
i۵ta a۵ ITR.PST.3SG.M he continually X-ed
i a۵i۵ PASS.PST.3SG.M he was X-ed
uša۵۵i۵ CAUS.PST.3SG.M he caused to X
```
```
This dimension of variation is perpendicular to the tense-mood-aspect templates. For exam-
ple, there are separate passive templates for the past, the present, the perfect, and so on,
resulting in a complex two-dimensional network of templates. Several of these are shown
in Table LP14.1 (practice applying them in Stop and Reflect LP14.2), but in reality there are
nearly a hundred such templates.
```
### STOP AND REFLECT LP14.2 MORE PRACTICE WITH TEMPLATES

```
Again using root š-k-n ‘to place,’ try determining the Akkadian words for the perfect ‘he had placed,’ the past
passive ‘it was placed,’ and the causative infinitive ‘to cause it to be placed.’
```
```
As if this weren’t enough, the two-dimensional mesh in Table LP14.1 needs to be com-
bined with yet another dimension: subject agreement, or the different persons that are
also marked on the verb. However, these markings for person are not indicated by further
internal vowel alterations, but rather in a somewhat more typical fashion, using prefixes
and suffixes. Here are a few examples for the simple past tense:

14.4 **Messiness due to Sound Changes**

```
The system as presented so far may seem to be the paragon of regular perfection, but in
reality, there are many exceptions that make the situation on the ground look much less
neat. In the third millennium BCE, Akkadian underwent several drastic sound changes as a
result of intense contact with Sumerian, a non-Semitic language. This is one major source of
untidiness in the language’s verbal system. Sumerian speakers evidently had difficulty with
the many glottal and pharyngeal consonants of the Semitic languages (sounds that can
still be heard in Arabic today), and during the centuries of intense contact with Sumerian,
Akkadian lost most of these “difficult” consonants. However, since many three-consonantal
roots originally contained such consonants, the drastic sound changes in Akkadian often
obscured the three-consonantal nature of the roots. For instance, the original Semitic root
ݧ-r-b (‘enter’) had as the first root consonant the pharyngeal fricative ݧ. When inserted
into the template for the simple past, i۵۵u۵, it originally resulted in the form iҍrub ‘he
entered.’ But by the end of the third millennium, the pharyngeal had disappeared, so the
sequence iҍ was reduced to a long vowel ɩ̄ to give the form Ưrub , where the three-consonantal
pattern is no longer so apparent.
While these irregularities, which developed in Akkadian because of contact-induced
sound changes, are of fairly late origin, there are other exceptions in the system which are
in fact far older, and which, as we shall see in a moment, are actually relics of very early
stages in the evolution of the Semitic verbal system.
```
14.5 **Historical Development**

```
How can a system like that of the Semitic verb have come into being? Research on gram-
maticalization has shone much light on the origin of affixes, even on the emergence of
complex paradigms of affixes. At first sight, the abstract idea of a purely consonantal root
and the algebraic template system seem to defy historical explanation through the blind
mechanisms of change, as they appear to have been designed
on the table of a gifted architect. In Deutscher (2005: chapter 6),
however, I tried to show how such a system could nevertheless
have emerged through entirely normal diachronic processes, in
particular, through cycles of sound change and analogy. While
```

you (female singular) blocked ta-ײװu׳-Ư
you (plural) blocked ta-ײװu׳-Ɨ
he/she cuts i-ײװu׳
```
```
Finally, in addition to subject agreement, there are also suffixes that mark pronominal
direct and indirect objects. So, for instance, aܒrud means ‘I sent,’ and aܒrud-akkuš-šu ‘I sent
him to you,’ where -akkuš means ‘to you’ and -šu means ‘him.’
```

**619 Language Profile 14 Akkadian**

```
a full presentation of the detailed argument goes beyond the
scope of this chapter, the following discussion presents some
of the basic principles of this claim. Interestingly, the clues for
understanding how the notion of a consonantal root system
could have emerged are all found in various types of exceptions
in the verbal system.
The most important of these exceptions can be called the “quirk vowel” (in traditional
grammars it is called the “root vowel”). I explained above that vowels are not part of the
root and only determine the grammatical nuance. While this is true in general, two of
the simplest templates (simple past and simple imperative) flout this rule, since they have
an arbitrary vowel between the last two root consonants, that is, an unmotivated vowel
which depends on each root itself. Thus, while some roots, like p-r-s, adhere to the template
i۵۵u۵ in the simple past ( iprus ‘he cut’), other roots, such as p-t-l ‘twist,’ have a different
vowel between the last root consonants. The past form of p-t-l is not ipt u l but ipt i l. The
difference in the vowel does not play any grammatical role. Rather, when you learn the
language, you simply have to memorize the “quirk vowel” of each root just as you have to
memorize the vowels of every English verb.
While the quirk vowel seems like an unmotivated irregularity from the synchronic per-
spective of the mature Semitic system, there are various indications that this quirk vowel is in
fact an extremely old feature, a relic from the time before the root-and-template system had
started to develop. The simple past tense thus points to a period when the ancestor language
still had more “normal” roots, like prus or ptil , that consisted of both vowels and consonants.
There are further revealing exceptions in the verbal system that suggest how such normal
roots were transformed into the purely consonantal design. The first step seems to have
been the development of a single internal vowel alteration that came to mark a distinction
in tense, a situation rather similar to English verbs such as sit–sat or drink–drank. I men-
tioned earlier that the future tense is formed with the template i۵a a۵. This is true of
regular verbs, but there are some verbs that disobey this rule. They are called “hollow,”
because they have only two consonants in their root instead of three (e.g., m-t ‘die,’ imnjt
‘he died’). The hollow verbs don’t follow the regular future-tense template, and instead
simply change their vowel to a: im ū t – im â t ‘he died’ – ‘he will die.’ In the attested stages of
Akkadian, such hollow verbs amount to only a few exceptions, but various factors indicate
that there were many more of them in earlier stages of the language. Indeed, it seems that
the pattern shown by hollow verbs – a single internal vowel mutation – was the earlier pat-
tern that marked the future tense of all verbs. So originally the corresponding future form
to the past tense iprus (‘he blocked’) would have been just ipras (see Textbox LP14.2).
```
### SIDEBAR LP14.6

```
See Section 12.3.3 for a discussion of
sound change and analogy.
```
```
The earlier stage of the verbal system which we have so far reconstructed had only one
internal vowel alteration to mark tense ( iprus – ipras ), had “normal” roots with both conso-
nants and vowels, and was not even dominated by roots with three consonants. How could
this system have metamorphosed into the mature Semitic system, with purely consonantal
roots of predominantly three consonants? A relatively easy part of the question is how
more three-consonant roots emerged. There are various indications that one of the main
paths for this process involved cycles such as the English ones below, where verbs become
longer through piling up of word-class-changing affixes:
```

**620 Guy Deutscher**

### VERB > NOUN > ADJECTIVE > VERB

```
(to) tail (=cut) tailor (to) tailor
(to) profess profess-ion profess-ion-al (to) profess-ion-al-ize
In the Semitic languages, such augmentations mainly involved prefixes rather than suf-
fixes. So a root that started out with two consonants, e.g., kun ‘to be firm,’ was turned into
an adjective ša-kun ‘firm/durable,’ and then (through functional shift) back to a verb šakun
‘to place, to establish.’ At some stage, as more and more such augmented verbs emerged,
roots with three consonants came to dominate the scene.
The trickier question is to understand how one simple vowel alteration ( iprus – ipras )
could have led to the idea of a purely consonantal root. The details are complex, but
in order to understand the consonantal root, we actually only need to investigate how
one further vowel alteration emerged, this time between the first two root consonants.
There are two possible places for internal vowels between three consonants: ۵v 1 ۵v 2 ۵, or
Position 1 and Position 2, for short. The vowel alteration in Position 1 could have emerged
through a combination of sound change and analogical back-formation. The following
discussion roughly describes the process. Augmented verbs (verbs like šakun , which had
acquired their third consonant through a prefix) had a vowel in Position 1 (the vowel of
the original augment prefix). But at some stage, a regular type of sound change deleted this
vowel in some phonetic environments. In particular, this sound change (called syncope )
deleted the middle vowel from any sequence of three short vowels in a row. In verbal
forms with prefixes, like the past-tense i-šakun , the middle short vowel was in Position
1: i-šakun > i-škun. But in verbal forms with suffixes, like the verbal adjective šakun-um ,
the middle vowel of the three was in Position 2: šakun-um > šakn-um. This is illustrated in
Figure LP14.3.
```
### TEXTBOX LP14.2 MUTATIONS IN INDO-EUROPEAN

```
It is not difficult to imagine how an internal vowel
mutation ( iprus – ipras ) could have emerged, because
there are parallel developments in other languages,
from more recent times. The most famous is the
i -mutation of Germanic, which is responsible for
the vowel alteration between English nouns such as
man – men , as well as causative English verbs such as
to fall – to fell. The original plural of mann in Germanic
would have been formed regularly, with a suffix - iz:
*mann-iz. But by a process of assimilation (specifically
vowel harmony), the vowel i of the suffix colored the
```
```
preceding a to e , resulting in menn-iz. The final -iz was
later reduced, leaving only men.
Similarly, the causative form ‘to fell’ goes back to a
Proto-Germanic suffix - ian (originally from a Proto-Indo-
European verb *yo ‘make’). *fall-ian ‘fall-make’ originally
became *fell-ian because of the i of the suffix, with the
ending entirely eroding later on, leaving only fell. The
Semitic vowel alteration to a would not have developed
through an assimilation to an -i suffix, of course, but
perhaps through the effect of a laryngeal. At any rate,
the basic principles could have been fairly similar.

This process was a “blind” sound change, conditioned only by the phonetic environ-
ment, not by meaning. But the result of this purely phonetic change created a pattern in
which one verbal form ( šakn-um ) had a vowel in Position 1, whereas another form ( i-škun )
had none (with the situation reversed in Position 2). For speakers in later generations, who
were no longer familiar with the phonetic motivation for the sound change, this pattern
could have come to be perceived as a bearer of a meaningful grammatical distinction. And
once it was perceived as such, it could have been extended by analogical back-formation to
roots like prus (which never had an augmented prefix to begin with), to produce a verbal
adjective pars-um , effectively inserting a vowel into Position 1 that had never originally
been there.
Once this pattern had been generalized to all verbs, it resulted in a system where the dif-
ferent verbal forms no longer shared any vowels: iprus (‘he blocked’), ipras (‘he will block’),
pars-um (‘blocked’). The root’s original vowel (the u in Position 2) appeared in only one
verbal form, so it no longer seemed to be the “default” vowel, but rather merely the vowel
of one particular tense. Moreover, vowels were not shared between all verbal forms in either
position, so both positions were seen to participate in the variation according to grammat-
ical function.
For a new generation of speakers, all that remained as a uniting factor between the dif-
ferent verbal forms were the three consonants, or the consonantal root. For example, what
now bears the core meaning ‘to block’ is no longer a pronounceable chunk prus , but the
three consonants p-r-s. So the consonantal root system is simply based on the emergence
of verbal forms that share the same consonants, but no longer share any vowels, and where
both vowel positions are grammatically variable. The templates such as i۵۵u۵, i۵۵a۵,
۵a۵۵um are really just a way of representing this pattern, whereby the internal vowels
are primarily determined by the grammatical nuance, and not by the whim of the root.
```
### CHAPTER SUMMARY

```
The Akkadian clay tablets provide a fascinating lens on both Mesopotamian civilization
and an early stage of Semitic, a language family famously known for its tri-consonantal
roots and templatic morphology. The system we have arrived at through this description
of prehistoric changes is still very simple and is worlds away from the dozens of templates
in the attested stages of the language. Deutscher (2000) shows how some of the more
elaborate templates could have emerged (such as passive, causative, reflexive, intensive)
```

**622 Guy Deutscher**

```
through relatively straightforward paths of grammaticalization. Once a few such templates
begin to emerge, speakers can start forming higher-level analogies, by superimposing
existing templates onto one another (e.g., if a passive template emerged in the past tense,
it could have been superimposed on the future tense, to give a future passive template).
Thus, the complexity of the system is a self-amplifying process, in which the templates
can interact by analogy in a grid-like way. A small number of templates might therefore
have proven enough of a “critical mass” to trigger an explosion in the number of new
templates, leading to the breathtaking sophistication of the attested system.

### EXERCISES

**1.** Based on the information about different templates given in the chapter, and using the root š-৬-r, which
    means ‘write’ or ‘inscribe,’ determine how to say in Akkadian: _you (pl.) wrote, he writes, write!_ (imperative or
    command form), _he made (someone) write, (something) is written._
**2.** The verb _liballi_ ṭ is a precative form (i.e., a wish form) of the root b-l-ṭ ‘be well/healthy,’ and means ‘may
    he make (someone) well.’ Can you identify the template on which the root was superimposed? In the letter
    quoted at the beginning of the chapter, there is a form _liballi_ ṭū _ka._ What elements have been added to the
    form and how do they change the meaning?
**3.** The form _iztanammar_ means ‘he keeps singing.’ Based on the templates in the chapter, can you identify
    the consonants of the Akkadian root ‘sing’?
**4.** In the following word written in the cuneiform script (Figure LP14.4), the first sign stands for h _a_ , the third
    for _mu_ , the fourth for _ra_. You can discover what the second and the fifth signs stand for based on the
    transcription of the letter presented earlier in Figure LP14.2. Can you figure out what name is written here?
